        "answer": "NOTE: This procedure applies specifically to aircraft models with engine nacelle configurations post-2015. For older models, refer to AMM revision 22B or later. Always verify tool availability before beginning.\n\n3.\nProcedures for Balancing Control Surfaces\nA.\nThe ight control surface balancing xture kit (part number 5180002-1) is shown in Figure 1.\n(1)\nBalance of control surfaces must be accomplished in a draft free room or area.\n(2)\nPlace hinge bolts through control surface hinges and position on knife edge balancing mandrels,\nrefer to Figure 2 for positioning of balancing control surfaces.\n(3)\nMake sure all control surfaces are in their approved ight conguration; painted (if applicable),\ntrim tabs installed, static wicks, and all tips installed.\n(4)\nPlace balancing mandrels on a table or other suitable at surface.\n(5)\nAdjust trailing edge support to t control surface being balanced while center of balancing beam\nis directly over hinge line. Remove balancing beam and balance the beam itself by adding\nwashers or nuts required at end opposite the trailing edge support.\n(6)\nWhen positioning balancing beam on control surface, avoid rivets to provide a smooth surface\nfor the beam and keep the beam 90 degrees to the hinge line of control surface.\n(7)\nPaint is a considerable weight factor.\nIn order to keep balance weight to a minimum, it\nis recommended that existing paint be removed before adding paint to a control surface.\nIncrease in balance weight will also be limited by the amount of space available and clearance\nwith adjacent parts.\nGood workmanship and standard repair practices should not result in\nunreasonable balance weight.\n(8)\nThe approximate amount of weight needed may be determined by taping loose weight at the\nbalance weight area.\n(9)\nLighten balance weight by drilling off part of weight.\n(10) Make balance weight heavier by fusing bar stock solder to weight after removal from control\nsurface. The ailerons should have balance weight increased by ordering additional weight and\ngang channel, listed in applicable Parts Catalog, and installing next to existing inboard weight\nthe minimum length necessary for correct balance, except that a length which contains at least\ntwo attaching screws must be used. If necessary, lighten new weight or existing weights for\ncorrect balance."
