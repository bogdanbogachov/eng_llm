        "question": "What is the implication of not discarding aluminum alloy fuel injection system components that exhibit cracks during the fluorescent penetrant inspection process on the overall safety and performance of the system?",
        "answer": "NOTICE: All maintenance intervals, part replacement schedules, overhaul cycles, the assessment technique, lifespan thresholds, rotation limits, etc., set by Cessna are solely based on the use of new, remanufactured, or overhauled Cessna-certified components. If parts are designed, manufactured, remanufactured, overhauled, purchased, and/or approved by third-party suppliers, then the data in Cessna’s maintenance/service manuals and parts catalogs do not apply and the purchaser is warned not to rely on such data for non-Cessna parts. All maintenance intervals, part replacement schedules, overhaul cycles, the assessment technique, lifespan thresholds, rotation limits, etc., for such non-Cessna parts must be obtained from the supplier or maker of such non-Cessna parts.\n\nFluorescent penetrant inspection must be performed on applicable aluminum alloy fuel injection\nsystem components by a certified technician in accordance with the instructions in section 6-12,\n\"Fluorescent Penetrant Inspection.\"\nDuring overhaul of fuel injection system components in accordance with Form X30593A all\naluminum alloy parts such as fuel pump body, vapor separator, manifold valve body, air throttle\nadapter body, covers and flanges must be fluorescent penetrant inspected by a certified\ntechnician in accordance with section 6-12, \"Fluorescent Penetrant Inspection,\" of this manual.\nAny components exhibiting cracks must be discarded."
