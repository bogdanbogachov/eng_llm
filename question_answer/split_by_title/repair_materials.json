        "question": "What material is typically used for steel sheet reinforcement in airplane repairs and what is its minimum heat treatment requirement?",
        "answer": "NOTICE: All maintenance intervals, changeover timelines, major service intervals, the inspection procedure, operational limits, usage cycles, etc., endorsed by Cessna are solely based on the use of new, remanufactured, or overhauled Cessna-certified components. If parts are designed, manufactured, remanufactured, overhauled, purchased, and/or approved by non-Cessna organizations, then the data in Cessna’s maintenance/service manuals and parts catalogs do not apply and the purchaser is warned not to rely on such data for non-Cessna parts. All maintenance intervals, changeover timelines, major service intervals, the inspection procedure, operational limits, usage cycles, etc., for such non-Cessna parts must be obtained from the supplier or maker of such non-Cessna parts.\n\n2.\nRepair Materials\nA.\nIn general, materials used in the airplane include 2024 and 7075 aluminum alloys. Sheet material\nrequiring little or no forming will generally be of 2024-T3 clad aluminum. Formed parts, such as ribs,\nbulkheads, etc., will be of 2024-T42 clad aluminum. Forgings are of 7075-T73. Materials used in\nrepairs should be, where possible, of the same material and heat treated to the same temper. The\nthickness should be equal to or greater than the material being repaired unless otherwise noted. If\nthe type of material cannot be readily determined and the forming required is not severe, 2024-T3\nmay be used generally, since the strength of -T3 is greater than that of -T4 or -T42 (-T4 and -T42 may\nbe used interchangeably, but they may not be substituted for -T3). When it is necessary to form a\npart with a smaller bend radius than the standard bend radius for 2024-T3 or 2024-T4, use 2024-0,\nand then heat treat to 2024-T42 after forming. In the event that the original temper was -T3, it may\nbe necessary to increase the material thickness sufciently to provide strength equivalent to that of\nthe original part. It is often practical to cut repair pieces from service parts listed in the parts catalog.\nSteel sheet material for reinforcement is 4130 steel heat treated to a minimum of 90,000 pounds per\nsquare inch. The rewall is annealed stainless steel sheet."

If\nthe type of material cannot be readily determined and the forming required is not severe, 2024-T3\nmay be used generally, since the strength of -T3 is greater than that of -T4 or -T42 (-T4 and -T42 may\nbe used interchangeably, but they may not be substituted for -T3). When it is necessary to form a\npart with a smaller bend radius than the standard bend radius for 2024-T3 or 2024-T4, use 2024-0,\nand then heat treat to 2024-T42 after forming. In the event that the original temper was -T3, it may\nbe necessary to increase the material thickness sufciently to provide strength equivalent to that of\nthe original part.

Materials used in\nrepairs should be, where possible, of the same material and heat treated to the same temper. The\nthickness should be equal to or greater than the material being repaired unless otherwise noted. If\nthe type of material cannot be readily determined and the forming required is not severe, 2024-T3\nmay be used generally, since the strength of -T3 is greater than that of -T4 or -T42 (-T4 and -T42 may\nbe used interchangeably, but they may not be substituted for -T3). When it is necessary to form a\npart with a smaller bend radius than the standard bend radius for 2024-T3 or 2024-T4, use 2024-0,\nand then heat treat to 2024-T42 after forming. In the event that the original temper was -T3, it may\nbe necessary to increase the material thickness sufciently to provide strength equivalent to that of\nthe original part. It is often practical to cut repair pieces from service parts listed in the parts catalog.\nSteel sheet material for reinforcement is 4130 steel heat treated to a minimum of 90,000 pounds per\nsquare inch.

Sheet material\nrequiring little or no forming will generally be of 2024-T3 clad aluminum. Formed parts, such as ribs,\nbulkheads, etc., will be of 2024-T42 clad aluminum. Forgings are of 7075-T73. Materials used in\nrepairs should be, where possible, of the same material and heat treated to the same temper. The\nthickness should be equal to or greater than the material being repaired unless otherwise noted. If\nthe type of material cannot be readily determined and the forming required is not severe, 2024-T3\nmay be used generally, since the strength of -T3 is greater than that of -T4 or -T42 (-T4 and -T42 may\nbe used interchangeably, but they may not be substituted for -T3). When it is necessary to form a\npart with a smaller bend radius than the standard bend radius for 2024-T3 or 2024-T4, use 2024-0,\nand then heat treat to 2024-T42 after forming. In the event that the original temper was -T3, it may\nbe necessary to increase the material thickness sufciently to provide strength equivalent to that of\nthe original part. It is often practical to cut repair pieces from service parts listed in the parts catalog.\nSteel sheet material for reinforcement is 4130 steel heat treated to a minimum of 90,000 pounds per\nsquare inch. The rewall is annealed stainless steel sheet."

All inspection schedules, changeover timelines, overhaul cycles, the inspection procedure, operational limits, rotation limits, etc., for such non-Cessna parts must be obtained from the supplier or maker of such non-Cessna parts.\n\n2.\nRepair Materials\nA.\nIn general, materials used in the airplane include 2024 and 7075 aluminum alloys. Sheet material\nrequiring little or no forming will generally be of 2024-T3 clad aluminum. Formed parts, such as ribs,\nbulkheads, etc., will be of 2024-T42 clad aluminum. Forgings are of 7075-T73. Materials used in\nrepairs should be, where possible, of the same material and heat treated to the same temper. The\nthickness should be equal to or greater than the material being repaired unless otherwise noted. If\nthe type of material cannot be readily determined and the forming required is not severe, 2024-T3\nmay be used generally, since the strength of -T3 is greater than that of -T4 or -T42 (-T4 and -T42 may\nbe used interchangeably, but they may not be substituted for -T3). When it is necessary to form a\npart with a smaller bend radius than the standard bend radius for 2024-T3 or 2024-T4, use 2024-0,\nand then heat treat to 2024-T42 after forming. In the event that the original temper was -T3, it may\nbe necessary to increase the material thickness sufciently to provide strength equivalent to that of\nthe original part. It is often practical to cut repair pieces from service parts listed in the parts catalog.\nSteel sheet material for reinforcement is 4130 steel heat treated to a minimum of 90,000 pounds per\nsquare inch. The rewall is annealed stainless steel sheet."

        "question": "What is the significance of ensuring that the bend radii and cross section areas are not reduced below the minimum shown in the diagrams when forming equivalent built-up sections for extrusions?",
        "answer": "IMPORTANT NOTICE: All inspection schedules, changeover timelines, major service intervals, the inspection procedure, operational limits, usage cycles, etc., specified by Cessna are solely based on the use of new, remanufactured, or overhauled Cessna-certified components. If parts are designed, manufactured, remanufactured, overhauled, purchased, and/or approved by non-Cessna organizations, then the data in Cessna’s maintenance/service manuals and parts catalogs are invalid and the purchaser is warned not to rely on such data for non-Cessna parts. All inspection schedules, changeover timelines, major service intervals, the inspection procedure, operational limits, usage cycles, etc., for such non-Cessna parts must be obtained from the producer or distributor of such non-Cessna parts.\n\n3.\nExtrusions and Formed Sections\nA.\n(Refer to Figure 1.) This section provides information on extrusions and formed sections. It also\nprovides details of equivalent built up sections for extrusions. Alternative materials are provided for\nequivalent sections and formed sections.\nB.\nUse of equivalent built up sections for extrusions are to be utilized only when the proper extrusions are\nnot available. They are intended to be cold formed from raw stock in sheet forms that have already\nbeen heat treated to the required condition. But when workability is required, the parts may be formed\nfrom 2024-0 aluminum and then heat treated to the -T42 condition before installation. When forming\nthe section, care must be taken to ensure that the bend radii and the cross section areas are not\nreduced below the minimum shown in the diagrams. In some cases, equivalent sections are not\ngiven because it is impractical to build them from sheet stock.\nC.\nIllustrated Parts Catalogs do not identify the standard shape from which parts are fabricated. Detailed\nmeasurements of damaged areas are required to determine the standard section from which parts\nare fabricated.\n"
