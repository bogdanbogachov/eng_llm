        "question": "What material is typically used for steel sheet reinforcement in airplane repairs and what is its minimum heat treatment requirement?",
        "answer": "WARNING: high-speed drill must never be used near fuselage skin due to risk of respiratory issues. Before beginning the bonding process, ensure that the area is free of coolant vapor and personnel are wearing inspection mirror.\n\n2.\nRepair Materials\nA.\nIn general, materials used in the airplane include 2024 and 7075 aluminum alloys. Sheet material\nrequiring little or no forming will generally be of 2024-T3 clad aluminum. Formed parts, such as ribs,\nbulkheads, etc., will be of 2024-T42 clad aluminum. Forgings are of 7075-T73. Materials used in\nrepairs should be, where possible, of the same material and heat treated to the same temper. The\nthickness should be equal to or greater than the material being repaired unless otherwise noted. If\nthe type of material cannot be readily determined and the forming required is not severe, 2024-T3\nmay be used generally, since the strength of -T3 is greater than that of -T4 or -T42 (-T4 and -T42 may\nbe used interchangeably, but they may not be substituted for -T3). When it is necessary to form a\npart with a smaller bend radius than the standard bend radius for 2024-T3 or 2024-T4, use 2024-0,\nand then heat treat to 2024-T42 after forming. In the event that the original temper was -T3, it may\nbe necessary to increase the material thickness sufciently to provide strength equivalent to that of\nthe original part. It is often practical to cut repair pieces from service parts listed in the parts catalog.\nSteel sheet material for reinforcement is 4130 steel heat treated to a minimum of 90,000 pounds per\nsquare inch. The rewall is annealed stainless steel sheet."

        "answer": "NOTE: This procedure applies specifically to aircraft models with landing gear strut configurations post-2015. For older models, refer to AMM revision 22B or later. Always verify ambient temperature before beginning.\n\n2.\nRepair Materials\nA.\nIn general, materials used in the airplane include 2024 and 7075 aluminum alloys. Sheet material\nrequiring little or no forming will generally be of 2024-T3 clad aluminum. Formed parts, such as ribs,\nbulkheads, etc., will be of 2024-T42 clad aluminum. Forgings are of 7075-T73. Materials used in\nrepairs should be, where possible, of the same material and heat treated to the same temper. The\nthickness should be equal to or greater than the material being repaired unless otherwise noted. If\nthe type of material cannot be readily determined and the forming required is not severe, 2024-T3\nmay be used generally, since the strength of -T3 is greater than that of -T4 or -T42 (-T4 and -T42 may\nbe used interchangeably, but they may not be substituted for -T3). When it is necessary to form a\npart with a smaller bend radius than the standard bend radius for 2024-T3 or 2024-T4, use 2024-0,\nand then heat treat to 2024-T42 after forming. In the event that the original temper was -T3, it may\nbe necessary to increase the material thickness sufciently to provide strength equivalent to that of\nthe original part.
