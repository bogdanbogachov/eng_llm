        "question": "What is the significance of considering the difference between a local cross-sectional area change and no cross-sectional area change in determining the type of damage to an airplane's skin, according to the manual's definitions of dent and other types of damage?",
        "answer": "NOTICE: All maintenance intervals, part replacement schedules, refurbishment limits, the assessment technique, lifespan thresholds, rotation limits, etc., specified by Cessna are solely based on the use of new, remanufactured, or overhauled certified Cessna parts. If parts are designed, manufactured, remanufactured, overhauled, purchased, and/or approved by third-party suppliers, then the data in Cessna’s maintenance/service manuals and parts catalogs are invalid and the purchaser is warned not to rely on such data for non-Cessna parts. All maintenance intervals, part replacement schedules, refurbishment limits, the assessment technique, lifespan thresholds, rotation limits, etc., for such non-Cessna parts must be obtained from the vendor or originator of such non-Cessna parts.\n\n1.\nGeneral\nA.\nFor the purposes of this manual, damage is considered to be a deviation from the original\nconguration of a structural part that compromises its structural integrity by signicantly reducing its\nstrength, signicantly decreasing its resistance to fatigue, signicantly increasing its susceptibility to\ncorrosion, signicantly altering its utter characteristics, or adversely affecting the ight characteristics\nof the airplane. This can include - but is not limited to - scratches, dents, dings, gouges, cracks,\ndrill starts, double drilled holes, plastic deformation, reduction in cross-sectional areas, changes in\ncomponent center-of-gravity, missing or inadequate fasteners, corrosion, dissimilar metal contact,\nwork hardening, temper change due to excessive heat, and so forth.\nB.\nUse good judgment in determining the type of signicant change to at stock structural material. The\nterms, dent, crease, abrasion, gouge, nick, scratch, crack and corrosion, referred to elsewhere in the\nmanual, are dened below as a guide for this determination, particularly with respect to the external\nskin of the airplane:\n(1)\nDent - A dent is normally a damaged area which is depressed with respect to its normal contour.\nThere is no cross sectional area change in the material. Area boundaries are smooth. Its form\nis generally the result of contact with a relatively smoothly contoured object.\nNOTE:\nA dent-like form of damage to skin may be the result of the peening action of a\nsmoothly contoured object contacting it. If the inner surface of skin shows no contour\nchange, consider that such damage results in a local cross sectional area change.\n(2)\nCrease - A damaged area which is depressed or folded back upon itself in such a manner that its\nboundaries are sharp or well dened lines or ridges. Consider it to be the equivalent of a crack.\n(3)\nAbrasion - An abrasion is a damaged area of any size which results in a cross sectional area\nchange due to scufng, rubbing, scraping or other surface erosion.\nIt is usually rough and\nirregular.\n(4)\nGouge - A gouge is a damaged area of any size, which results in a cross sectional area change.\nIt is usually caused by contact with a relatively sharp object which produces a continuous, sharp\nor smooth channel-like groove in the material.\n(5)\nNick - A nick is a local gouge with sharp edges. Consider a series of nicks, in a line pattern to\nbe the equivalent of a gouge.\n(6)\nScratch - A scratch is a line of damage of any depth in the material and results in a cross sectional\narea change. It is usually caused by contact with a very sharp object.\n(7)\nCrack - A crack is a partial fracture or complete break in the material with the most signicant\ncross sectional area change. In appearance, it is usually an irregular line and is normally the\nresult of fatigue failure.\n(8)\nCorrosion - Corrosion, due to a complex electrochemical action, is a damaged area of any size\nand depth which results in a cross sectional area change. Depth of such pitting damage must\nbe determined by a cleanup operation. Damage of this type may occur on surfaces of structural\nelements. Refer to Corrosion and Corrosion Control, Section .\nC.\nUse good sense and proper visual measurement in the determination of signicant cross sectional\narea changes of both depth and length of any type (or combinations) of damage mentioned above."

All inspection schedules, changeover timelines, major service intervals, the inspection procedure, operational limits, usage cycles, etc., for such non-Cessna parts must be obtained from the producer or distributor of such non-Cessna parts.\n\n2.\nDamage Investigation\nA.\nAfter a thorough cleaning of the damaged area, all structural parts should be carefully examined\nto determine the extent of damage. Frequently, the force causing the initial damage is transmitted\nfrom one member to the next, causing strains and distortions. Abnormal stresses incurred by shock\nor impact forces on a rib, bulkhead, or similar structure, may be transmitted to the extremity of the\nstructural member, resulting in secondary damage, such as sheared or stretched rivets, elongated bolt\nholes, or canned skins or bulkheads. Points of attachment should be examined carefully for distortion\nand security of fastenings in the primary and secondary damaged areas at locations beyond the local\ndamage. This is particularly true with wing tip, horizontal stabilizer tip, or vertical n tip damage. If\nthe damage is due to an aft load, the rear spars should be checked for indications of compression\ndamage for the full length, including the fuselage components."

All inspection schedules, replacement periods, overhaul cycles, the assessment technique, lifespan thresholds, cycle thresholds, etc., for such non-Cessna parts must be obtained from the supplier or maker of such non-Cessna parts.\n\n1.\nGeneral\nA.\nFor the purposes of this manual, damage is considered to be a deviation from the original\nconguration of a structural part that compromises its structural integrity by signicantly reducing its\nstrength, signicantly decreasing its resistance to fatigue, signicantly increasing its susceptibility to\ncorrosion, signicantly altering its utter characteristics, or adversely affecting the ight characteristics\nof the airplane. This can include - but is not limited to - scratches, dents, dings, gouges, cracks,\ndrill starts, double drilled holes, plastic deformation, reduction in cross-sectional areas, changes in\ncomponent center-of-gravity, missing or inadequate fasteners, corrosion, dissimilar metal contact,\nwork hardening, temper change due to excessive heat, and so forth.\nB.\nUse good judgment in determining the type of signicant change to at stock structural material. The\nterms, dent, crease, abrasion, gouge, nick, scratch, crack and corrosion, referred to elsewhere in the\nmanual, are dened below as a guide for this determination, particularly with respect to the external\nskin of the airplane:\n(1)\nDent - A dent is normally a damaged area which is depressed with respect to its normal contour.\nThere is no cross sectional area change in the material. Area boundaries are smooth. Its form\nis generally the result of contact with a relatively smoothly contoured object.\nNOTE:\nA dent-like form of damage to skin may be the result of the peening action of a\nsmoothly contoured object contacting it. If the inner surface of skin shows no contour\nchange, consider that such damage results in a local cross sectional area change.\n(2)\nCrease - A damaged area which is depressed or folded back upon itself in such a manner that its\nboundaries are sharp or well dened lines or ridges. Consider it to be the equivalent of a crack.\n(3)\nAbrasion - An abrasion is a damaged area of any size which results in a cross sectional area\nchange due to scufng, rubbing, scraping or other surface erosion.\nIt is usually rough and\nirregular.\n(4)\nGouge - A gouge is a damaged area of any size, which results in a cross sectional area change.\nIt is usually caused by contact with a relatively sharp object which produces a continuous, sharp\nor smooth channel-like groove in the material.\n(5)\nNick - A nick is a local gouge with sharp edges. Consider a series of nicks, in a line pattern to\nbe the equivalent of a gouge.\n(6)\nScratch - A scratch is a line of damage of any depth in the material and results in a cross sectional\narea change. It is usually caused by contact with a very sharp object.\n(7)\nCrack - A crack is a partial fracture or complete break in the material with the most signicant\ncross sectional area change. In appearance, it is usually an irregular line and is normally the\nresult of fatigue failure.\n(8)\nCorrosion - Corrosion, due to a complex electrochemical action, is a damaged area of any size\nand depth which results in a cross sectional area change. Depth of such pitting damage must\nbe determined by a cleanup operation. Damage of this type may occur on surfaces of structural\nelements. Refer to Corrosion and Corrosion Control, Section .\nC.\nUse good sense and proper visual measurement in the determination of signicant cross sectional\narea changes of both depth and length of any type (or combinations) of damage mentioned above."

Frequently, the force causing the initial damage is transmitted\nfrom one member to the next, causing strains and distortions. Abnormal stresses incurred by shock\nor impact forces on a rib, bulkhead, or similar structure, may be transmitted to the extremity of the\nstructural member, resulting in secondary damage, such as sheared or stretched rivets, elongated bolt\nholes, or canned skins or bulkheads. Points of attachment should be examined carefully for distortion\nand security of fastenings in the primary and secondary damaged areas at locations beyond the local\ndamage. This is particularly true with wing tip, horizontal stabilizer tip, or vertical n tip damage. If\nthe damage is due to an aft load, the rear spars should be checked for indications of compression\ndamage for the full length, including the fuselage components."

The\nterms, dent, crease, abrasion, gouge, nick, scratch, crack and corrosion, referred to elsewhere in the\nmanual, are dened below as a guide for this determination, particularly with respect to the external\nskin of the airplane:\n(1)\nDent - A dent is normally a damaged area which is depressed with respect to its normal contour.\nThere is no cross sectional area change in the material. Area boundaries are smooth. Its form\nis generally the result of contact with a relatively smoothly contoured object.\nNOTE:\nA dent-like form of damage to skin may be the result of the peening action of a\nsmoothly contoured object contacting it.

Consider it to be the equivalent of a crack.\n(3)\nAbrasion - An abrasion is a damaged area of any size which results in a cross sectional area\nchange due to scufng, rubbing, scraping or other surface erosion.\nIt is usually rough and\nirregular.\n(4)\nGouge - A gouge is a damaged area of any size, which results in a cross sectional area change.\nIt is usually caused by contact with a relatively sharp object which produces a continuous, sharp\nor smooth channel-like groove in the material.\n(5)\nNick - A nick is a local gouge with sharp edges.

        "answer": "ATTENTION: All maintenance intervals, changeover timelines, major service intervals, the assessment technique, durability limits, cycle thresholds, etc., endorsed by Cessna are solely based on the use of new, remanufactured, or overhauled parts approved by Cessna. If parts are designed, manufactured, remanufactured, overhauled, purchased, and/or approved by third-party suppliers, then the data in Cessna’s maintenance/service manuals and parts catalogs do not apply and the purchaser is warned not to rely on such data for non-Cessna parts. All maintenance intervals, changeover timelines, major service intervals, the assessment technique, durability limits, cycle thresholds, etc., for such non-Cessna parts must be obtained from the vendor or originator of such non-Cessna parts.\n\n1.\nGeneral\nA.\nFor the purposes of this manual, damage is considered to be a deviation from the original\nconguration of a structural part that compromises its structural integrity by signicantly reducing its\nstrength, signicantly decreasing its resistance to fatigue, signicantly increasing its susceptibility to\ncorrosion, signicantly altering its utter characteristics, or adversely affecting the ight characteristics\nof the airplane. This can include - but is not limited to - scratches, dents, dings, gouges, cracks,\ndrill starts, double drilled holes, plastic deformation, reduction in cross-sectional areas, changes in\ncomponent center-of-gravity, missing or inadequate fasteners, corrosion, dissimilar metal contact,\nwork hardening, temper change due to excessive heat, and so forth.\nB.\nUse good judgment in determining the type of signicant change to at stock structural material. The\nterms, dent, crease, abrasion, gouge, nick, scratch, crack and corrosion, referred to elsewhere in the\nmanual, are dened below as a guide for this determination, particularly with respect to the external\nskin of the airplane:\n(1)\nDent - A dent is normally a damaged area which is depressed with respect to its normal contour.\nThere is no cross sectional area change in the material. Area boundaries are smooth. Its form\nis generally the result of contact with a relatively smoothly contoured object.\nNOTE:\nA dent-like form of damage to skin may be the result of the peening action of a\nsmoothly contoured object contacting it. If the inner surface of skin shows no contour\nchange, consider that such damage results in a local cross sectional area change.\n(2)\nCrease - A damaged area which is depressed or folded back upon itself in such a manner that its\nboundaries are sharp or well dened lines or ridges. Consider it to be the equivalent of a crack.\n(3)\nAbrasion - An abrasion is a damaged area of any size which results in a cross sectional area\nchange due to scufng, rubbing, scraping or other surface erosion.\nIt is usually rough and\nirregular.\n(4)\nGouge - A gouge is a damaged area of any size, which results in a cross sectional area change.\nIt is usually caused by contact with a relatively sharp object which produces a continuous, sharp\nor smooth channel-like groove in the material.\n(5)\nNick - A nick is a local gouge with sharp edges. Consider a series of nicks, in a line pattern to\nbe the equivalent of a gouge.\n(6)\nScratch - A scratch is a line of damage of any depth in the material and results in a cross sectional\narea change. It is usually caused by contact with a very sharp object.\n(7)\nCrack - A crack is a partial fracture or complete break in the material with the most signicant\ncross sectional area change. In appearance, it is usually an irregular line and is normally the\nresult of fatigue failure.\n(8)\nCorrosion - Corrosion, due to a complex electrochemical action, is a damaged area of any size\nand depth which results in a cross sectional area change. Depth of such pitting damage must\nbe determined by a cleanup operation. Damage of this type may occur on surfaces of structural\nelements. Refer to Corrosion and Corrosion Control, Section .\nC.\nUse good sense and proper visual measurement in the determination of signicant cross sectional\narea changes of both depth and length of any type (or combinations) of damage mentioned above."

        "question": "What factors should be taken into account when examining the structural integrity of an aircraft's rear spars and fuselage components to determine the full extent of damage caused by an aft load?",
        "answer": "IMPORTANT NOTICE: All inspection schedules, changeover timelines, overhaul cycles, the inspection procedure, durability limits, usage cycles, etc., specified by Cessna are solely based on the use of new, remanufactured, or overhauled parts approved by Cessna. If parts are designed, manufactured, remanufactured, overhauled, purchased, and/or approved by non-Cessna organizations, then the data in Cessna’s maintenance/service manuals and parts catalogs are invalid and the purchaser is warned not to rely on such data for non-Cessna parts. All inspection schedules, changeover timelines, overhaul cycles, the inspection procedure, durability limits, usage cycles, etc., for such non-Cessna parts must be obtained from the producer or distributor of such non-Cessna parts.\n\n2.\nDamage Investigation\nA.\nAfter a thorough cleaning of the damaged area, all structural parts should be carefully examined\nto determine the extent of damage. Frequently, the force causing the initial damage is transmitted\nfrom one member to the next, causing strains and distortions. Abnormal stresses incurred by shock\nor impact forces on a rib, bulkhead, or similar structure, may be transmitted to the extremity of the\nstructural member, resulting in secondary damage, such as sheared or stretched rivets, elongated bolt\nholes, or canned skins or bulkheads. Points of attachment should be examined carefully for distortion\nand security of fastenings in the primary and secondary damaged areas at locations beyond the local\ndamage. This is particularly true with wing tip, horizontal stabilizer tip, or vertical n tip damage. If\nthe damage is due to an aft load, the rear spars should be checked for indications of compression\ndamage for the full length, including the fuselage components."
