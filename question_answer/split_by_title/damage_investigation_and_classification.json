        "question": "What is the relevance of understanding the difference between various types of damage, such as dents, creases, and abrasions, in assessing the structural integrity of an airplane's components, according to the manual?",
        "answer": "1.\nGeneral\nA.\nFor the purposes of this manual, damage is considered to be a deviation from the original\nconguration of a structural part that compromises its structural integrity by signicantly reducing its\nstrength, signicantly decreasing its resistance to fatigue, signicantly increasing its susceptibility to\ncorrosion, signicantly altering its utter characteristics, or adversely affecting the ight characteristics\nof the airplane. This can include - but is not limited to - scratches, dents, dings, gouges, cracks,\ndrill starts, double drilled holes, plastic deformation, reduction in cross-sectional areas, changes in\ncomponent center-of-gravity, missing or inadequate fasteners, corrosion, dissimilar metal contact,\nwork hardening, temper change due to excessive heat, and so forth.\nB.\nUse good judgment in determining the type of signicant change to at stock structural material. The\nterms, dent, crease, abrasion, gouge, nick, scratch, crack and corrosion, referred to elsewhere in the\nmanual, are dened below as a guide for this determination, particularly with respect to the external\nskin of the airplane:\n(1)\nDent - A dent is normally a damaged area which is depressed with respect to its normal contour.\nThere is no cross sectional area change in the material. Area boundaries are smooth. Its form\nis generally the result of contact with a relatively smoothly contoured object.\nNOTE:\nA dent-like form of damage to skin may be the result of the peening action of a\nsmoothly contoured object contacting it. If the inner surface of skin shows no contour\nchange, consider that such damage results in a local cross sectional area change.\n(2)\nCrease - A damaged area which is depressed or folded back upon itself in such a manner that its\nboundaries are sharp or well dened lines or ridges. Consider it to be the equivalent of a crack.\n(3)\nAbrasion - An abrasion is a damaged area of any size which results in a cross sectional area\nchange due to scufng, rubbing, scraping or other surface erosion.\nIt is usually rough and\nirregular.\n(4)\nGouge - A gouge is a damaged area of any size, which results in a cross sectional area change.\nIt is usually caused by contact with a relatively sharp object which produces a continuous, sharp\nor smooth channel-like groove in the material.\n(5)\nNick - A nick is a local gouge with sharp edges. Consider a series of nicks, in a line pattern to\nbe the equivalent of a gouge.\n(6)\nScratch - A scratch is a line of damage of any depth in the material and results in a cross sectional\narea change. It is usually caused by contact with a very sharp object.\n(7)\nCrack - A crack is a partial fracture or complete break in the material with the most signicant\ncross sectional area change. In appearance, it is usually an irregular line and is normally the\nresult of fatigue failure.\n(8)\nCorrosion - Corrosion, due to a complex electrochemical action, is a damaged area of any size\nand depth which results in a cross sectional area change. Depth of such pitting damage must\nbe determined by a cleanup operation. Damage of this type may occur on surfaces of structural\nelements. Refer to Corrosion and Corrosion Control, Section .\nC.\nUse good sense and proper visual measurement in the determination of signicant cross sectional\narea changes of both depth and length of any type (or combinations) of damage mentioned above."

Abnormal stresses incurred by shock\nor impact forces on a rib, bulkhead, or similar structure, may be transmitted to the extremity of the\nstructural member, resulting in secondary damage, such as sheared or stretched rivets, elongated bolt\nholes, or canned skins or bulkheads.

        "answer": "1.\nGeneral\nA.\nFor the purposes of this manual, damage is considered to be a deviation from the original\nconguration of a structural part that compromises its structural integrity by signicantly reducing its\nstrength, signicantly decreasing its resistance to fatigue, signicantly increasing its susceptibility to\ncorrosion, signicantly altering its utter characteristics, or adversely affecting the ight characteristics\nof the airplane. This can include - but is not limited to - scratches, dents, dings, gouges, cracks,\ndrill starts, double drilled holes, plastic deformation, reduction in cross-sectional areas, changes in\ncomponent center-of-gravity, missing or inadequate fasteners, corrosion, dissimilar metal contact,\nwork hardening, temper change due to excessive heat, and so forth.\nB.\nUse good judgment in determining the type of signicant change to at stock structural material. The\nterms, dent, crease, abrasion, gouge, nick, scratch, crack and corrosion, referred to elsewhere in the\nmanual, are dened below as a guide for this determination, particularly with respect to the external\nskin of the airplane:\n(1)\nDent - A dent is normally a damaged area which is depressed with respect to its normal contour.\nThere is no cross sectional area change in the material. Area boundaries are smooth. Its form\nis generally the result of contact with a relatively smoothly contoured object.\nNOTE:\nA dent-like form of damage to skin may be the result of the peening action of a\nsmoothly contoured object contacting it. If the inner surface of skin shows no contour\nchange, consider that such damage results in a local cross sectional area change.\n(2)\nCrease - A damaged area which is depressed or folded back upon itself in such a manner that its\nboundaries are sharp or well dened lines or ridges. Consider it to be the equivalent of a crack.\n(3)\nAbrasion - An abrasion is a damaged area of any size which results in a cross sectional area\nchange due to scufng, rubbing, scraping or other surface erosion.\nIt is usually rough and\nirregular.\n(4)\nGouge - A gouge is a damaged area of any size, which results in a cross sectional area change.\nIt is usually caused by contact with a relatively sharp object which produces a continuous, sharp\nor smooth channel-like groove in the material.\n(5)\nNick - A nick is a local gouge with sharp edges. Consider a series of nicks, in a line pattern to\nbe the equivalent of a gouge.\n(6)\nScratch - A scratch is a line of damage of any depth in the material and results in a cross sectional\narea change. It is usually caused by contact with a very sharp object.\n(7)\nCrack - A crack is a partial fracture or complete break in the material with the most signicant\ncross sectional area change. In appearance, it is usually an irregular line and is normally the\nresult of fatigue failure.\n(8)\nCorrosion - Corrosion, due to a complex electrochemical action, is a damaged area of any size\nand depth which results in a cross sectional area change. Depth of such pitting damage must\nbe determined by a cleanup operation. Damage of this type may occur on surfaces of structural\nelements. Refer to Corrosion and Corrosion Control, Section .\nC.\nUse good sense and proper visual measurement in the determination of signicant cross sectional\narea changes of both depth and length of any type (or combinations) of damage mentioned above."

This can include - but is not limited to - scratches, dents, dings, gouges, cracks,\ndrill starts, double drilled holes, plastic deformation, reduction in cross-sectional areas, changes in\ncomponent center-of-gravity, missing or inadequate fasteners, corrosion, dissimilar metal contact,\nwork hardening, temper change due to excessive heat, and so forth.\nB.\nUse good judgment in determining the type of signicant change to at stock structural material. The\nterms, dent, crease, abrasion, gouge, nick, scratch, crack and corrosion, referred to elsewhere in the\nmanual, are dened below as a guide for this determination, particularly with respect to the external\nskin of the airplane:\n(1)\nDent - A dent is normally a damaged area which is depressed with respect to its normal contour.\nThere is no cross sectional area change in the material. Area boundaries are smooth. Its form\nis generally the result of contact with a relatively smoothly contoured object.\nNOTE:\nA dent-like form of damage to skin may be the result of the peening action of a\nsmoothly contoured object contacting it. If the inner surface of skin shows no contour\nchange, consider that such damage results in a local cross sectional area change.\n(2)\nCrease - A damaged area which is depressed or folded back upon itself in such a manner that its\nboundaries are sharp or well dened lines or ridges. Consider it to be the equivalent of a crack.\n(3)\nAbrasion - An abrasion is a damaged area of any size which results in a cross sectional area\nchange due to scufng, rubbing, scraping or other surface erosion.\nIt is usually rough and\nirregular.\n(4)\nGouge - A gouge is a damaged area of any size, which results in a cross sectional area change.\nIt is usually caused by contact with a relatively sharp object which produces a continuous, sharp\nor smooth channel-like groove in the material.\n(5)\nNick - A nick is a local gouge with sharp edges. Consider a series of nicks, in a line pattern to\nbe the equivalent of a gouge.\n(6)\nScratch - A scratch is a line of damage of any depth in the material and results in a cross sectional\narea change. It is usually caused by contact with a very sharp object.\n(7)\nCrack - A crack is a partial fracture or complete break in the material with the most signicant\ncross sectional area change. In appearance, it is usually an irregular line and is normally the\nresult of fatigue failure.\n(8)\nCorrosion - Corrosion, due to a complex electrochemical action, is a damaged area of any size\nand depth which results in a cross sectional area change. Depth of such pitting damage must\nbe determined by a cleanup operation. Damage of this type may occur on surfaces of structural\nelements. Refer to Corrosion and Corrosion Control, Section .\nC.\nUse good sense and proper visual measurement in the determination of signicant cross sectional\narea changes of both depth and length of any type (or combinations) of damage mentioned above."

The\nterms, dent, crease, abrasion, gouge, nick, scratch, crack and corrosion, referred to elsewhere in the\nmanual, are dened below as a guide for this determination, particularly with respect to the external\nskin of the airplane:\n(1)\nDent - A dent is normally a damaged area which is depressed with respect to its normal contour.\nThere is no cross sectional area change in the material. Area boundaries are smooth. Its form\nis generally the result of contact with a relatively smoothly contoured object.\nNOTE:\nA dent-like form of damage to skin may be the result of the peening action of a\nsmoothly contoured object contacting it. If the inner surface of skin shows no contour\nchange, consider that such damage results in a local cross sectional area change.\n(2)\nCrease - A damaged area which is depressed or folded back upon itself in such a manner that its\nboundaries are sharp or well dened lines or ridges. Consider it to be the equivalent of a crack.\n(3)\nAbrasion - An abrasion is a damaged area of any size which results in a cross sectional area\nchange due to scufng, rubbing, scraping or other surface erosion.\nIt is usually rough and\nirregular.\n(4)\nGouge - A gouge is a damaged area of any size, which results in a cross sectional area change.\nIt is usually caused by contact with a relatively sharp object which produces a continuous, sharp\nor smooth channel-like groove in the material.\n(5)\nNick - A nick is a local gouge with sharp edges. Consider a series of nicks, in a line pattern to\nbe the equivalent of a gouge.\n(6)\nScratch - A scratch is a line of damage of any depth in the material and results in a cross sectional\narea change. It is usually caused by contact with a very sharp object.\n(7)\nCrack - A crack is a partial fracture or complete break in the material with the most signicant\ncross sectional area change. In appearance, it is usually an irregular line and is normally the\nresult of fatigue failure.\n(8)\nCorrosion - Corrosion, due to a complex electrochemical action, is a damaged area of any size\nand depth which results in a cross sectional area change. Depth of such pitting damage must\nbe determined by a cleanup operation. Damage of this type may occur on surfaces of structural\nelements. Refer to Corrosion and Corrosion Control, Section .\nC.\nUse good sense and proper visual measurement in the determination of signicant cross sectional\narea changes of both depth and length of any type (or combinations) of damage mentioned above."
