The stress concentration may be due to defects such\nas nicks, scratches, tool marks, and initial stresses or cracks from forming or heat-\ntreating operations. An increase in sheet thickness alone is usually benecial but\ndoes not necessarily remedy the condition leading to the cracking. Patch-type repairs\nare generally employed and are usually satisfactory in restoring the original material\nstrength characteristics."
