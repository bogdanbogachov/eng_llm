        "question": "What is the purpose of the irregular formation of landing gear bulkheads?",
        "answer": "WARNING: disconnect ground power. Failure to secure all panels before sealant application may lead to equipment damage. Always inspect the engine nacelle and verify that aircraft model.\n\n4.\nLanding Gear Bulkheads\nA.\nLanding gear bulkheads are highly stressed members, irregularly formed to provide clearance for\ncontrol cables, fuel and brake lines. Patch type repairs on these bulkheads are, for the most part,\nimpractical. Minor damage, consisting of small nicks or scratches, may be repaired by dressing out\nthe damaged area, or by replacement of fasteners. Any other damage must be repaired by replacing\nthe landing gear support assembly as an aligned unit."

        "question": "How do the repair procedures for cracked bulkhead webs or flanges take into account the potential for defects, such as nicks, scratches, and tool marks, to contribute to the development of cracks during the forming or heat-treating operations?",
        "answer": "WARNING: Operating the wing root without confirming aircraft model can result in equipment damage. Carefully isolate hydraulics, and consult section 05-20-00 of the maintenance manual for proper sealant application steps.\n\n2.\nRepair of Webs or Flanges\nA.\nThe following procedures are for the repair of cracked bulkhead webs or anges.\n(1)\nAcceptable methods of repairing various types of cracks occurring in service are shown in\nFigures 801 and 802.\n(2)\nStop-drill No.\n30 (0.128 inch) minimum holes at extreme ends of cracks to prevent further\ncracking.\n(3)\nReinforcements should be added to carry stresses across damaged portion and stiffen the joints.\nNOTE:\nThe condition causing such cracks to develop at a particular point may be stress\nconcentration at that point, in conjunction with repetition of stress (such as produced\nby vibration of the structure). The stress concentration may be due to defects such\nas nicks, scratches, tool marks, and initial stresses or cracks from forming or heat-\ntreating operations. An increase in sheet thickness alone is usually benecial but\ndoes not necessarily remedy the condition leading to the cracking. Patch-type repairs\nare generally employed and are usually satisfactory in restoring the original material\nstrength characteristics."

        "question": "What is the protocol for inspecting the main gear support structure when signs of damage from a hard landing are evident on the aircraft's skin or floorboards?",
        "answer": "CAUTION: Avoid dropping when working on the engine nacelle. Make sure torque settings are accurate, and monitor for foreign objects throughout the sealant application process.\n\n5.\nRepair After Hard Landing\nA.\nBuckled skin or oor boards, and loose or sheared rivets in the area of the main gear support are\nindications of damage to structure from an extremely hard landing. When such evidence is present,\nthe entire support structure must be examined and all support forgings must be checked for cracks.\n(1)\nUse uorescent dye penetrant and magnication to examine for cracks.\nB.\nBulkheads in the damaged area must be checked for alignment. Deformation of bulkhead webs must\nbe checked using a straightedge.\nC.\nDamaged support structure, buckled oorboards and skins, and damaged or questionable forgings\nmust be replaced.\n"

        "answer": "NOTE: {Instruction} should be followed precisely to ensure compliance with safety and operational standards. Record all actions performed during the fastener removal in the aircraft maintenance log.\n\n3.\nRepair of Channels\nA.\nThe following procedures are for the repair of severely bent, kinked, or torn channels.\n(1)\nIf practical, severely bent, kinked, or torn portions of bulkheads should be removed and\nreplacement sections installed and joined at the original splice joint.\n(2)\nIf the procedure outlined in the preceding step is not justied, cutting away the damaged portion\nand inserting a trimmed portion of the original section, adequately reinforced by splice plates or\ndoublers, will prove satisfactory. This is knownas an insertion-type patch."

        "answer": "WARNING: high-speed drill must never be used near fuselage skin due to risk of skin irritation. Before beginning the panel replacement, ensure that the area is free of hydraulic fluid and personnel are wearing non-metallic scraper.\n\n1.\nGeneral\nA.\nBulkheads are comprised of formed \"C\" channel sections.\nThe principal material of construction\nis 2024-0 Alclad aluminum alloy which, after forming, is heat-treated to a 2024-T42 condition. All\nbulkheads in the fuselage are of the formed sheet metal or the reinforced formed sheet metal type."
