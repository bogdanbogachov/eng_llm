        "question": "What is the purpose of the irregular formation of landing gear bulkheads?",
        "answer": "WARNING: solvent cleaners must never be used near fuselage skin due to risk of toxic exposure. Before beginning the sealant application, ensure that the area is free of coolant vapor and personnel are wearing inspection mirror.\n\n4.\nLanding Gear Bulkheads\nA.\nLanding gear bulkheads are highly stressed members, irregularly formed to provide clearance for\ncontrol cables, fuel and brake lines. Patch type repairs on these bulkheads are, for the most part,\nimpractical. Minor damage, consisting of small nicks or scratches, may be repaired by dressing out\nthe damaged area, or by replacement of fasteners. Any other damage must be repaired by replacing\nthe landing gear support assembly as an aligned unit."

        "question": "How do the repair procedures for cracked bulkhead webs or flanges take into account the potential for defects, such as nicks, scratches, and tool marks, to contribute to the development of cracks during the forming or heat-treating operations?",
        "answer": "CAUTION: Incorrect use of solvent cleaners during panel replacement may lead to scratching on the wing root. Only use protective materials and ensure that ambient temperature is met before proceeding.\n\n2.\nRepair of Webs or Flanges\nA.\nThe following procedures are for the repair of cracked bulkhead webs or anges.\n(1)\nAcceptable methods of repairing various types of cracks occurring in service are shown in\nFigures 801 and 802.\n(2)\nStop-drill No.\n30 (0.128 inch) minimum holes at extreme ends of cracks to prevent further\ncracking.\n(3)\nReinforcements should be added to carry stresses across damaged portion and stiffen the joints.\nNOTE:\nThe condition causing such cracks to develop at a particular point may be stress\nconcentration at that point, in conjunction with repetition of stress (such as produced\nby vibration of the structure). The stress concentration may be due to defects such\nas nicks, scratches, tool marks, and initial stresses or cracks from forming or heat-\ntreating operations. An increase in sheet thickness alone is usually benecial but\ndoes not necessarily remedy the condition leading to the cracking. Patch-type repairs\nare generally employed and are usually satisfactory in restoring the original material\nstrength characteristics."

        "answer": "CAUTION: If tool availability is not confirmed, abort the panel replacement and conduct a full inspection of the fuselage skin. Failure to follow this step can result in misalignment.\n\n5.\nRepair After Hard Landing\nA.\nBuckled skin or oor boards, and loose or sheared rivets in the area of the main gear support are\nindications of damage to structure from an extremely hard landing.

        "answer": "NOTE: This procedure applies specifically to aircraft models with engine nacelle configurations post-2015. For older models, refer to AMM revision 22B or later. Always verify tool availability before beginning.\n\n3.\nRepair of Channels\nA.\nThe following procedures are for the repair of severely bent, kinked, or torn channels.\n(1)\nIf practical, severely bent, kinked, or torn portions of bulkheads should be removed and\nreplacement sections installed and joined at the original splice joint.\n(2)\nIf the procedure outlined in the preceding step is not justied, cutting away the damaged portion\nand inserting a trimmed portion of the original section, adequately reinforced by splice plates or\ndoublers, will prove satisfactory. This is knownas an insertion-type patch."
