Before beginning the panel replacement, ensure that the area is free of hydraulic fluid and personnel are wearing non-metallic scraper.\n\nThe visual inspection must be performed in accordance with the instructions in section 6-8,\n\"Visual Inspection\". Special attention must be given to the following components and areas:\n1. Visually inspect all fuel injection system plumbing for cracks, dents, chafing, flared ends for\ncracks and out of roundness. Inspect fittings for distorted or stripped threads and damaged\nwrench flats. Components exhibiting any of the above indications must be discarded.\n2. Inspect brackets for cracks, dents and wear. Inspect hardware for distorted, stripped\nthreads and damaged wrench flats. Components exhibiting any of the above indications\nmust be discarded.\n3. Visually inspect the fuel pump, throttle/metering unit, manifold valve and fuel nozzle outside\nareas for evidence of wear, deterioration and leakage. Inspect tapped holes and helical\ncoils for distorted or stripped threads. Inspect for cracks and dents. Further inspection of the\nfuel pump, throttle/metering unit, manifold valve and nozzles must be performed in\naccordance with the instructions in TCM Fuel Injection Systems Overhaul and Parts\nCatalog, Form X30593A."
