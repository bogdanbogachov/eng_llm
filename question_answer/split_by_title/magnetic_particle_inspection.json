        "question": "What is the importance of thoroughly cleaning a part before magnetic particle inspection to ensure accurate results?",
        "answer": "CAUTION…Before magnetic particle inspection of any part, it must be completely cleaned\nand free of dirt, carbon, varnish, gum and paint. Plug small holes leading to obscure cavities\nwith tight-fitting wood plugs or with a hard grease which is soluble in lubricating oil. This will\nprevent particles from lodging in places where they would be difficult to remove and places\nnot subject to visual inspection. After magnetic particle inspection remove all such plugs and\nclean the part thoroughly in solvent. Dry the part with compressed air. Check for complete\ndemagnetization.\nMagnetic particle inspection must be conducted on all ferrous parts.\nWhere magnetic particle inspection is required use fluorescent method wet continuous\nprocedure. Refer to the latest revision of ASTM E 1444 for specific methods and procedures\nbased on the type of inspection being performed.\nACCEPT / REJECT CRITERIA\nRejectable discontinuities are any of the following: fatigue cracks, forming cracks, grinding\nand heat treat cracks, embrittlement cracks, seams, laps, burst.\nParts which contain linear indications which cannot be reworked or indications which break\ninto comers, edges, holes, thread roots, fillets, gear tooth roots or keyways must be rejected.\nThe particular magnetic particle manufacturer's information regarding use, safety data and\ndisposal must be followed carefully."
