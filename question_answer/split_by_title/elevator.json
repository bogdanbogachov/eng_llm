        "answer": "WARNING: Inadequate panel replacement of the engine nacelle may compromise aircraft integrity. Always wear insulated gloves, follow approved methods, and check for discoloration before returning to service.\n\nELEVATOR\n1.\nGeneral\nA.\nThe elevator assembly consists of a left and right section bolted together near the airplane centerline\nby torque tubes. Each section consists of a front and a rear spar, ribs, skins, and a trim tab assembly.\nA balance weight is bolted to the outboard tip leading edge.\n2.\nNegligible Damage\nA.\nAny smooth skin dents that are free from cracks, abrasions, and sharp corners, and which are not\nstress wrinkles and do not interfere with any internal structure or mechanism, may be considered\nas negligible damage. Exception to negligible damage on elevator surfaces is the front spar, cracks\nappearing in web of hinge tting or in tip rib which supports overhanging balance weight. Cracks\nin overhanging tip rib, in the area at the front spar intersection with web of the rib, also cannot be\nconsidered negligible.\n3.\nRepairable Damage\nA.\nSkin patches may be used to repair skin damage. These patches are illustrated in Chapter 51, Typical\nSkin Repairs, Figure 801. For skin damage which includes corrugations, refer to Chapter 51, Typical\nSkin Repairs, Figure 802.\nB.\nFlight control surfaces must be balanced after repair or painting, in accordance with balancing\nprocedures outlined in Chapter 51, Flight Control Surface Balancing.\n4.\nReplacement Damage\nA.\nWarped and cracked skin, ribs, and hinge brackets are replaceable items.\nWhere damage is\nextensive, replacement of the entire assembly is recommended.\n"
