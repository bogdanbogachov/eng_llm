        "title": "VISUAL INSPECTION",
        "question": "How does the visual inspection process using a magnifying glass help in identifying potential issues with the studs and threaded parts of engine components?",
        "answer": "NOTICE: All checkup timelines, changeover timelines, major service intervals, the assessment technique, operational limits, cycle thresholds, etc., endorsed by Cessna are solely based on the use of new, remanufactured, or overhauled Cessna-certified components. If parts are designed, manufactured, remanufactured, overhauled, purchased, and/or approved by third-party suppliers, then the data in Cessna’s maintenance/service manuals and parts catalogs do not apply and the purchaser is warned not to rely on such data for non-Cessna parts. All checkup timelines, changeover timelines, major service intervals, the assessment technique, operational limits, cycle thresholds, etc., for such non-Cessna parts must be obtained from the vendor or originator of such non-Cessna parts.\n\nAll engine parts except those to be replaced 100% must be inspected visually with at least a\n10 X (power) magnifying glass under good light for surface damage such as nicks, dents,\ndeep scratches, visible cracks, distortion, burned areas, pitting, transfer of metal, corrosion,\nerosion and removal of enamel coating. Visual inspection should also determine the need for\nfurther cleaning of obscure areas. Inspect all studs for bending, looseness or partial removal.\nInspect all threaded parts for nicks and other damage to the screw threads. After visual\ninspection place the engine parts in three groups: apparently serviceable parts, repairable\nparts and parts to be discarded.\nNOTE...See Chapters 7 through 17 for specific individual system components and part visual\ninspection instructions."
