        "question": "How does the process of visual inspection using a magnifying glass contribute to the overall assessment of the condition of engine parts that are not scheduled for replacement?",
        "answer": "All engine parts except those to be replaced 100% must be inspected visually with at least a\n10 X (power) magnifying glass under good light for surface damage such as nicks, dents,\ndeep scratches, visible cracks, distortion, burned areas, pitting, transfer of metal, corrosion,\nerosion and removal of enamel coating. Visual inspection should also determine the need for\nfurther cleaning of obscure areas. Inspect all studs for bending, looseness or partial removal.\nInspect all threaded parts for nicks and other damage to the screw threads. After visual\ninspection place the engine parts in three groups: apparently serviceable parts, repairable\nparts and parts to be discarded.\nNOTE...See Chapters 7 through 17 for specific individual system components and part visual\ninspection instructions."
