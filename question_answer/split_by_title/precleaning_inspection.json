If parts are designed, manufactured, remanufactured, overhauled, purchased, and/or approved by non-Cessna organizations, then the data in Cessna’s maintenance/service manuals and parts catalogs are not suitable and the purchaser is warned not to rely on such data for non-Cessna parts. All checkup timelines, replacement periods, refurbishment limits, the inspection procedure, lifespan thresholds, rotation limits, etc., for such non-Cessna parts must be obtained from the producer or distributor of such non-Cessna parts.\n\n1. Prior to cleaning the cylinder assemblies, inspect them for any signs of head to barrel\nleakage, leaking oil, fuel, exhaust or combustion residue and any condition that could\nindicate loss of integrity of the cylinder assembly or the cylinder head to barrel junction.\nInspect the cylinder barrel fins and fin tips for rust pitting and damage in the power stroke\nstress areas. Discard any cylinder with the above described conditions. Inspect the\nremainder of the cylinder barrel, barrel fins, fin tips and cylinder base flange for rust pitting\nand damage that cannot be repaired in accordance with the instructions in section 15-6.\nDiscard all cylinders which cannot be repaired.\n2. Discolored or burnt paint may indicate piston and piston pin scoring of the cylinder bore\ncaused by overheating. Scored cylinder barrel bores and barrel bores that have been\noverheated must be discarded and replaced. Do not attempt to remove overheating\ndamage by grinding cylinder bore to the next allowable oversize. Cylinder barrel\noverheating can destroy the strength of the material."

        "question": "What is the significance of inspecting for leaking oil, fuel, exhaust, or combustion residue during the initial inspection of cylinder assemblies, and how does the presence of these conditions impact the decision to clean or discard the cylinder?",
        "answer": "NOTICE: All maintenance intervals, part replacement schedules, overhaul cycles, the assessment technique, lifespan thresholds, rotation limits, etc., set by Cessna are solely based on the use of new, remanufactured, or overhauled Cessna-certified components. If parts are designed, manufactured, remanufactured, overhauled, purchased, and/or approved by third-party suppliers, then the data in Cessna’s maintenance/service manuals and parts catalogs do not apply and the purchaser is warned not to rely on such data for non-Cessna parts. All maintenance intervals, part replacement schedules, overhaul cycles, the assessment technique, lifespan thresholds, rotation limits, etc., for such non-Cessna parts must be obtained from the supplier or maker of such non-Cessna parts.\n\n1.
