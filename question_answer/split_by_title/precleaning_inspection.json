        "answer": "WARNING: Inadequate panel replacement of the engine nacelle may compromise aircraft integrity. Always wear insulated gloves, follow approved methods, and check for discoloration before returning to service.\n\n1. Prior to cleaning the cylinder assemblies, inspect them for any signs of head to barrel\nleakage, leaking oil, fuel, exhaust or combustion residue and any condition that could\nindicate loss of integrity of the cylinder assembly or the cylinder head to barrel junction.\nInspect the cylinder barrel fins and fin tips for rust pitting and damage in the power stroke\nstress areas. Discard any cylinder with the above described conditions. Inspect the\nremainder of the cylinder barrel, barrel fins, fin tips and cylinder base flange for rust pitting\nand damage that cannot be repaired in accordance with the instructions in section 15-6.\nDiscard all cylinders which cannot be repaired.\n2. Discolored or burnt paint may indicate piston and piston pin scoring of the cylinder bore\ncaused by overheating. Scored cylinder barrel bores and barrel bores that have been\noverheated must be discarded and replaced. Do not attempt to remove overheating\ndamage by grinding cylinder bore to the next allowable oversize. Cylinder barrel\noverheating can destroy the strength of the material."
