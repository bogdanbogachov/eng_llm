If parts are designed, manufactured, remanufactured, overhauled, purchased, and/or approved by third-party suppliers, then the data in Cessna’s maintenance/service manuals and parts catalogs do not apply and the purchaser is warned not to rely on such data for non-Cessna parts. All inspection schedules, replacement periods, overhaul cycles, the assessment technique, durability limits, usage cycles, etc., for such non-Cessna parts must be obtained from the supplier or maker of such non-Cessna parts.\n\nDOOR DAMAGE CLASSIFICATION\n1.\nRepairable Damage\nA.\nBonded doors may be repaired by the same methods used for riveted structure.\nRivets are a\nsatisfactory substitute for bonded seams on these assemblies. The strength of the bonded seams in\ndoors may be replaced by a single 3/32, 2117-AD rivet per running inch of bond seam. The standard\nrepair procedures outlined in AC43.13-1b are also applicable to bonded doors.\n"
