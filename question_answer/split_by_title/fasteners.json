Only use protective materials and ensure that ambient temperature is met before proceeding.\n\n10.\nThreaded Fasteners Bolt Torques\nA.\nThe importance of correct application cannot be overemphasized. Refer to appropriate Maintenance\nManual, Chapter 20, Torque Data - Maintenance Practices, for additional information covering torque\nvalues. Under torque can result in unnecessary wear of nuts and bolts as well as parts they are\nholding together. When insufcient pressures are applied, uneven loads will be transmitted throughout\nassembly, which may result in excessive wear or premature failure due to fatigue. Over torque can\nbe equally damaging because of failure of a bolt or nut from overstressing threaded areas. There are\na few simple, but very important, procedures that should be followed to assure that correct torque is\napplied:\n(1)\nCalibrate torque wrench periodically to assure accuracy, and recheck frequently.\n(2)\nBe sure that bolt and nut threads are clean and dry unless otherwise specied.\n(3)\nRun nut down to near contact with washer or bearing surface and check friction drag torque\nrequired to turn nut.\n(4)\nAdd friction drag torque to desired torque recommended. Refer to appropriate Maintenance\nManual, Chapter 20, Torque Data - Maintenance Practices to obtain complete torque calculating\nprocedures. This is referred to as nal torque which should register on indicator or setting for a\nsnap over-type wrench.\n(5)\nApply a smooth even pull when applying torque pressure. If chattering or a jerking motion occurs\nduring nal torque, back off and re-torque.\n(6)\nWhen installing a castellated nut, start alignment with cotter pin hole at minimum recommended\ntorque plus friction drag torque, and do not exceed maximum torque plus friction drag. If hole\nand nut castellation do not align, change washers or nut and try again. Exceeding maximum\nrecommended torque is not recommended unless specically allowed or recommended for that\nparticular installation."

        "question": "What are the specific considerations and guidelines for handling and replacing solid shank rivets in areas where exterior paint has been applied to the rivet heads, and how can the presence of hardened paint and hairline cracks be distinguished from actual rivet looseness?",
        "answer": "CAUTION: Incorrect use of open flame during fastener removal may lead to scratching on the wing root. Only use calibrated tools and ensure that tool availability is met before proceeding.\n\n7.\nSolid Shank Rivets\nA.\nRemoval of Solid Shank Rivets (Refer to Figure 1).\n(1)\nWhen it becomes necessary to replace a rivet, extreme care should be taken in its removal so\nthat the rivet hole will retain its original size and replacement with a larger size rivet will not be\nnecessary. If the rivet is not removed properly, the strength of the joint may be weakened and\nthe replacement of rivets made more difcult.\n(2)\nWhen removing a rivet, work on the manufactured head. It is more symmetrical about the shank\nthan the shop head, and there will be less chance of damaging the rivet hole or the material\naround it. To remove rivets, use hand tools, a power drill or a combination of both. The preferred\nmethod is to drill through the rivet head and drive out the remainder of the rivet with a drift punch.\nFirst, le a at area on the head of any round or brazier head rivet, and center punch the at\nsurface for drilling. On thin metal, back up the rivet on the shop head when center punching\nto avoid depressing the metal. The dimple in 2117-T3 rivets usually eliminates the necessity of\nling and center punching the rivet.\n(3)\nSelect a drill one size smaller than the rivet shank and drill out the rivet head. When using a\npower drill, set the drill on the rivet and rotate the chuck several revolutions by hand before\nturning on the power. This procedure helps the drill cut a good starting spot and eliminates the\nchance of the drill slipping off and tracking across the metal. While holding the drill at a 90Â°\nangle, drill the rivet to the depth of its head. Be careful not to drill too deep because the rivet\nshank will turn with the drill and cause a tear. The rivet head will often break away and climb the\ndrill, which is a good signal to withdraw the drill. If the rivet head does not come lose of its own\naccord, insert a drift punch into the hole and twist slightly to either side until the head comes off.\n(4)\nDrive out the shank of the rivet with a drift punch slightly smaller than the diameter of the shank.\nOn thin metal or unsupported structures, support the sheet with a bucking bar while driving out\nthe shank. If the shank is exceptionally tight after the rivet head is removed, drill the rivet about\ntwo-thirds of the way through the thickness of the material and then drive out the remainder of\nthe rivet with a drift punch.\n(5)\nThe removal of ush rivets is the same as that just described except that no ling of the\nmanufactured head is required before center punching. Be very careful to avoid elongation\nof the dimpled or the countersunk holes. The rivet head should be drilled to approximately\none-half the thickness of the top sheet.\nTable 1.

NAS1738M4-4\nrivets may be identied as AIA/NAS1738M4-4.\nC.\nInstallation of Solid Shank Rivets.\n(1)\nA large percentage of riveting of airplane structure is accomplished on thin gauge aluminum alloy,\nand the work must be accomplished without distorting or damaging the material with hammer\nblows or riveting tools. All airplane power riveting is accomplished by upsetting the rivets against\na bucking bar instead of striking the shank with a hammer. To prevent deforming the rivet head,\na rivet set must be selected to t each type of rivet. The depth of this set must not touch material\nbeing riveted. Parts requiring heat treatment should be heat treated before riveting, since heat\ntreating process after rivet installation causes warping. Assemblies that require heat treatment\nin a salt bath must be treated prior to assembly, as the salt cannot be entirely washed out of the\njoints.\n(2)\nThe use of hollow rivets in joining highly stressed parts is not permitted. To determine if blind\nrivets may be substituted, refer to Tables 1 and 2. Selection of the proper rivet and the proper\nnumber of rivets is very important. Rivets must be of the proper length for the total thickness of\nthe parts being riveted. Ordinarily, from 1-1/2 to 2 times the diameter of the rivet is the correct\namount for the rivet shank to protrude through the material to form the head. For heavy material,\nsuch as plates or ttings, from 2 to 2-1/2 times the rivet diameter may be used. The rivet should\nnot be excessively loose in the hole, as this condition will cause the rivet to bend over while\nbeing driven, and the shank will not be sufciently expanded to completely ll the hole. A drill\nfrom 0.002 inch to 0.004 inch larger than the rivet shank should be used for sheet and plate\nriveting. Parts should be held rmly together by clamps, screws, or bolts while they are being\ndrilled or riveted. The bucking bar is to be held against the end of the rivet shank. Exercise care\nwhile accomplishing this operation to prevent unseating the rivet by too much pressure. For the\nrst few blows, the bucking bar should be held lightly against the rivet shank so it will receive\nthe impact of the blow through the rivet. The bucking bar must be held square with the rivet\nto produce uniform upsets. As few blows as possible should be struck to properly upset rivet.\nBlows must be as uniform as possible.\nD.\nLoose Or Working Solid Shank Rivets.\n(1)\nRivets which appear to be loose shall be checked with a 0.002 inch feeler gauge by inserting the\ngauge around the head of the rivet in question. If the feeler gauge can be inserted to the shank\nof the rivet, it shall be classied as a loose rivet and it shall be replaced. If the feeler gauge can\nbe inserted approximately halfway to the shank for less than 30 percent of the circumference\nof the rivet head, it shall not be classied as a loose rivet. The feeler gauge shall be used to\ncheck the shear section between the riveted members (such as skin to spar or different sections\nof skins) in a similar manner to that used around the rivet head. If the skin around the brazier\nhead or countersunk rivet can be moved by depressing the skin with nger pressure around the\nrivet, the rivet shall be replaced. If a rivet is found which turns by applying a rotating load to the\nhead of the rivet, it should be replaced.\n(2)\nIn areas where exterior paint has been applied to rivet heads, the paint may harden due to aging\nprocesses and show hairline cracks around the edge of the rivet heads. This should not be\nused as a basis for determining whether or not the rivet is loose. The hardened paint may crack\nat times and collect dirt or exhaust fumes which will appear as discoloration. It is not possible\nto detect loose rivets visually. Replacement rivets should be of like size and type. In some\ninstances, however, it will be necessary to use the next size larger diameter. For general repair\npractices, the spacing between the centerlines of adjacent rivet holes shall be four diameters or\ngreater. In some areas where the spacing between rivets prohibits the use of the next larger\nrivets, special repair instructions and procedures shall be followed.\nContact Cessna Single\nEngine Support."

        "answer": "NOTE: This procedure applies specifically to aircraft models with engine nacelle configurations post-2015. For older models, refer to AMM revision 22B or later. Always verify tool availability before beginning.\n\n11.\nRivets for Plastic or Composite Parts\nA.\nUnlike rivets in metallic joints, blind rivets are often the rivet of choice for riveting non-metallic materials\nbecause they may be installed without the hammering necessary to install solid rivets. If the tail end\nof the rivet is adjacent to the non-metal side, install a washer over the shank to prevent the \"hole\nlling\" action built into blind rivets from overloading the non-metal hole. The hole in the washer should\nmatch the specied installation hole for the fastener. If the tail end of the rivet is installed through\nmetal substructure, the washer is not necessary.\nB.\nSoft (\"A\" 1100 aluminum shank rivets or \"B\" 5056 aluminum shank) rivets are also used to install non-\nmetallic parts. Original equipment soft rivets will be either red or green colored under the paint. If the\nbutt or driven end of the rivet is adjacent to the non-metallic part, it is preferable to install a washer over\nthe shank to prevent the rivet shank, which swells during driving, from overloading the non-metallic\nhole. The hole in the washer should match the specied installation hole for the fastener. If the tail\nend of the rivet is installed through metal substructure, the washer is not necessary. Take care when\ndriving rivets through non-metal to not overdrive the rivet. If the rivet is overdriven, the shank will swell\neven with the washer in place. The rivet butt should be driven to no more than necessary to retain\nthe part, never more than 1.4 times the shank diameter.\nC.\nIf the original equipment rivet provided connection between metal parts as well as non-metallic parts,\nit may be a standard (AD) rivet. Original equipment AD rivets are colored gold or uncolored. Replace\noriginal equipment AD rivets with AD rivets.\n"

NAS1738M4-4\nrivets may be identied as AIA/NAS1738M4-4.\nC.\nInstallation of Solid Shank Rivets.\n(1)\nA large percentage of riveting of airplane structure is accomplished on thin gauge aluminum alloy,\nand the work must be accomplished without distorting or damaging the material with hammer\nblows or riveting tools. All airplane power riveting is accomplished by upsetting the rivets against\na bucking bar instead of striking the shank with a hammer. To prevent deforming the rivet head,\na rivet set must be selected to t each type of rivet. The depth of this set must not touch material\nbeing riveted. Parts requiring heat treatment should be heat treated before riveting, since heat\ntreating process after rivet installation causes warping. Assemblies that require heat treatment\nin a salt bath must be treated prior to assembly, as the salt cannot be entirely washed out of the\njoints.\n(2)\nThe use of hollow rivets in joining highly stressed parts is not permitted. To determine if blind\nrivets may be substituted, refer to Tables 1 and 2. Selection of the proper rivet and the proper\nnumber of rivets is very important. Rivets must be of the proper length for the total thickness of\nthe parts being riveted. Ordinarily, from 1-1/2 to 2 times the diameter of the rivet is the correct\namount for the rivet shank to protrude through the material to form the head. For heavy material,\nsuch as plates or ttings, from 2 to 2-1/2 times the rivet diameter may be used. The rivet should\nnot be excessively loose in the hole, as this condition will cause the rivet to bend over while\nbeing driven, and the shank will not be sufciently expanded to completely ll the hole. A drill\nfrom 0.002 inch to 0.004 inch larger than the rivet shank should be used for sheet and plate\nriveting. Parts should be held rmly together by clamps, screws, or bolts while they are being\ndrilled or riveted. The bucking bar is to be held against the end of the rivet shank. Exercise care\nwhile accomplishing this operation to prevent unseating the rivet by too much pressure. For the\nrst few blows, the bucking bar should be held lightly against the rivet shank so it will receive\nthe impact of the blow through the rivet. The bucking bar must be held square with the rivet\nto produce uniform upsets. As few blows as possible should be struck to properly upset rivet.\nBlows must be as uniform as possible.\nD.\nLoose Or Working Solid Shank Rivets.\n(1)\nRivets which appear to be loose shall be checked with a 0.002 inch feeler gauge by inserting the\ngauge around the head of the rivet in question. If the feeler gauge can be inserted to the shank\nof the rivet, it shall be classied as a loose rivet and it shall be replaced. If the feeler gauge can\nbe inserted approximately halfway to the shank for less than 30 percent of the circumference\nof the rivet head, it shall not be classied as a loose rivet. The feeler gauge shall be used to\ncheck the shear section between the riveted members (such as skin to spar or different sections\nof skins) in a similar manner to that used around the rivet head. If the skin around the brazier\nhead or countersunk rivet can be moved by depressing the skin with nger pressure around the\nrivet, the rivet shall be replaced. If a rivet is found which turns by applying a rotating load to the\nhead of the rivet, it should be replaced.\n(2)\nIn areas where exterior paint has been applied to rivet heads, the paint may harden due to aging\nprocesses and show hairline cracks around the edge of the rivet heads. This should not be\nused as a basis for determining whether or not the rivet is loose. The hardened paint may crack\nat times and collect dirt or exhaust fumes which will appear as discoloration. It is not possible\nto detect loose rivets visually. Replacement rivets should be of like size and type. In some\ninstances, however, it will be necessary to use the next size larger diameter. For general repair\npractices, the spacing between the centerlines of adjacent rivet holes shall be four diameters or\ngreater. In some areas where the spacing between rivets prohibits the use of the next larger\nrivets, special repair instructions and procedures shall be followed.\nContact Cessna Single\nEngine Support."

        "answer": "WARNING: solvent cleaners must never be used near fuselage skin due to risk of toxic exposure. Before beginning the sealant application, ensure that the area is free of coolant vapor and personnel are wearing inspection mirror.\n\n2.\nRivets\nA.\nStandard solid shank MS rivets are those generally used in airplane construction.\nThey are\nfabricated in the following head types:\nroundhead, athead, countersunk head, and universal\nhead. Flathead rivets are generally used in the airplane interior, where head clearance is required.\nMS20426 countersunk head rivets are used on the exterior surfaces of the airplane to minimize\nturbulent airow. MS20470 universal head rivets are used on the exterior surfaces of the airplane\nwhere strength requirements necessitate a stronger rivet head than that of the countersunk head\nrivet. Hi-Shear rivets are special, patented rivets having a high shear strength equivalent to that of\nstandard NAS bolts. They are used in special cases in locations where high shear loads are present,\nsuch as in spars, wings, and in heavy bulkhead ribs. This rivet consists of a cadmium plated pin of\nalloy steel. Some have a collar of aluminum alloy. Some of these rivets can be readily identied by\nthe presence of the attached collar in place of the formed head on standard rivets. Blind rivets are\nused, where strength requirements permit, where one side of the structure is inaccessible, making it\nimpossible or impractical to drive standard solid shank rivets."

        "question": "In the context of riveting, what is the relationship between the thickness of the sheet and the diameter of the rivets in determining the spacing between rivets when they are arranged in rows, and how does this impact the structural integrity of the riveted joint?",
        "answer": "NOTE: If the engine nacelle shows any signs of cracks, do not proceed with the panel replacement until proper inspection and corrective action have been taken.\n\n9.\nSpacing Of Rivets\nA.\nThere are no specic rules which are applicable to every case or type of riveting. There are, however,\ncertain general rules which should be understood and followed. Edge distance of rivets should not\nbe less than two diameters of the rivet, measured from the edge of the sheet or plate to the center of\nthe rivet hole. Spacing between rivets, when in rows, depends upon several factors, principally the\nthickness of the sheet, the diameter of the rivets, and the manner in which the sheet will be stressed.\nThis spacing is seldom less than four diameters of the rivet, measured between the centers of the rivet\nholes. Rivets, spaced four diameters apart, are found in certain seams of semimonocoque fuselages,\nwebs or built up spars, and various plates or ttings. Where there are two rows of rivets, they are\nusually staggered. The transverse pitch or distance between rows should be slightly less than the\npitch of the rivets, with 75 percent of the rivet pitch being the usual practice. An average spacing or\npitch of rivets in the cover or skin of most structures, except at highly stressed points, will be from 6\nto 12 diameters of the rivet. The best practice in repair is to make pitch of rivets equal to those in the\noriginal structure."

Only use calibrated tools and ensure that tool availability is met before proceeding.\n\n7.\nSolid Shank Rivets\nA.\nRemoval of Solid Shank Rivets (Refer to Figure 1).\n(1)\nWhen it becomes necessary to replace a rivet, extreme care should be taken in its removal so\nthat the rivet hole will retain its original size and replacement with a larger size rivet will not be\nnecessary. If the rivet is not removed properly, the strength of the joint may be weakened and\nthe replacement of rivets made more difcult.\n(2)\nWhen removing a rivet, work on the manufactured head. It is more symmetrical about the shank\nthan the shop head, and there will be less chance of damaging the rivet hole or the material\naround it. To remove rivets, use hand tools, a power drill or a combination of both. The preferred\nmethod is to drill through the rivet head and drive out the remainder of the rivet with a drift punch.\nFirst, le a at area on the head of any round or brazier head rivet, and center punch the at\nsurface for drilling. On thin metal, back up the rivet on the shop head when center punching\nto avoid depressing the metal. The dimple in 2117-T3 rivets usually eliminates the necessity of\nling and center punching the rivet.\n(3)\nSelect a drill one size smaller than the rivet shank and drill out the rivet head. When using a\npower drill, set the drill on the rivet and rotate the chuck several revolutions by hand before\nturning on the power. This procedure helps the drill cut a good starting spot and eliminates the\nchance of the drill slipping off and tracking across the metal. While holding the drill at a 90Â°\nangle, drill the rivet to the depth of its head. Be careful not to drill too deep because the rivet\nshank will turn with the drill and cause a tear. The rivet head will often break away and climb the\ndrill, which is a good signal to withdraw the drill. If the rivet head does not come lose of its own\naccord, insert a drift punch into the hole and twist slightly to either side until the head comes off.\n(4)\nDrive out the shank of the rivet with a drift punch slightly smaller than the diameter of the shank.\nOn thin metal or unsupported structures, support the sheet with a bucking bar while driving out\nthe shank. If the shank is exceptionally tight after the rivet head is removed, drill the rivet about\ntwo-thirds of the way through the thickness of the material and then drive out the remainder of\nthe rivet with a drift punch.\n(5)\nThe removal of ush rivets is the same as that just described except that no ling of the\nmanufactured head is required before center punching. Be very careful to avoid elongation\nof the dimpled or the countersunk holes. The rivet head should be drilled to approximately\none-half the thickness of the top sheet.\nTable 1.

NAS1738M4-4\nrivets may be identied as AIA/NAS1738M4-4.\nC.\nInstallation of Solid Shank Rivets.\n(1)\nA large percentage of riveting of airplane structure is accomplished on thin gauge aluminum alloy,\nand the work must be accomplished without distorting or damaging the material with hammer\nblows or riveting tools. All airplane power riveting is accomplished by upsetting the rivets against\na bucking bar instead of striking the shank with a hammer. To prevent deforming the rivet head,\na rivet set must be selected to t each type of rivet. The depth of this set must not touch material\nbeing riveted. Parts requiring heat treatment should be heat treated before riveting, since heat\ntreating process after rivet installation causes warping. Assemblies that require heat treatment\nin a salt bath must be treated prior to assembly, as the salt cannot be entirely washed out of the\njoints.\n(2)\nThe use of hollow rivets in joining highly stressed parts is not permitted. To determine if blind\nrivets may be substituted, refer to Tables 1 and 2. Selection of the proper rivet and the proper\nnumber of rivets is very important. Rivets must be of the proper length for the total thickness of\nthe parts being riveted. Ordinarily, from 1-1/2 to 2 times the diameter of the rivet is the correct\namount for the rivet shank to protrude through the material to form the head. For heavy material,\nsuch as plates or ttings, from 2 to 2-1/2 times the rivet diameter may be used. The rivet should\nnot be excessively loose in the hole, as this condition will cause the rivet to bend over while\nbeing driven, and the shank will not be sufciently expanded to completely ll the hole. A drill\nfrom 0.002 inch to 0.004 inch larger than the rivet shank should be used for sheet and plate\nriveting. Parts should be held rmly together by clamps, screws, or bolts while they are being\ndrilled or riveted. The bucking bar is to be held against the end of the rivet shank. Exercise care\nwhile accomplishing this operation to prevent unseating the rivet by too much pressure. For the\nrst few blows, the bucking bar should be held lightly against the rivet shank so it will receive\nthe impact of the blow through the rivet. The bucking bar must be held square with the rivet\nto produce uniform upsets. As few blows as possible should be struck to properly upset rivet.\nBlows must be as uniform as possible.\nD.\nLoose Or Working Solid Shank Rivets.\n(1)\nRivets which appear to be loose shall be checked with a 0.002 inch feeler gauge by inserting the\ngauge around the head of the rivet in question. If the feeler gauge can be inserted to the shank\nof the rivet, it shall be classied as a loose rivet and it shall be replaced. If the feeler gauge can\nbe inserted approximately halfway to the shank for less than 30 percent of the circumference\nof the rivet head, it shall not be classied as a loose rivet. The feeler gauge shall be used to\ncheck the shear section between the riveted members (such as skin to spar or different sections\nof skins) in a similar manner to that used around the rivet head. If the skin around the brazier\nhead or countersunk rivet can be moved by depressing the skin with nger pressure around the\nrivet, the rivet shall be replaced. If a rivet is found which turns by applying a rotating load to the\nhead of the rivet, it should be replaced.\n(2)\nIn areas where exterior paint has been applied to rivet heads, the paint may harden due to aging\nprocesses and show hairline cracks around the edge of the rivet heads. This should not be\nused as a basis for determining whether or not the rivet is loose. The hardened paint may crack\nat times and collect dirt or exhaust fumes which will appear as discoloration. It is not possible\nto detect loose rivets visually. Replacement rivets should be of like size and type. In some\ninstances, however, it will be necessary to use the next size larger diameter. For general repair\npractices, the spacing between the centerlines of adjacent rivet holes shall be four diameters or\ngreater. In some areas where the spacing between rivets prohibits the use of the next larger\nrivets, special repair instructions and procedures shall be followed.\nContact Cessna Single\nEngine Support."

Before beginning the sealant application, ensure that the area is free of coolant vapor and personnel are wearing inspection mirror.\n\n2.\nRivets\nA.\nStandard solid shank MS rivets are those generally used in airplane construction.\nThey are\nfabricated in the following head types:\nroundhead, athead, countersunk head, and universal\nhead. Flathead rivets are generally used in the airplane interior, where head clearance is required.\nMS20426 countersunk head rivets are used on the exterior surfaces of the airplane to minimize\nturbulent airow. MS20470 universal head rivets are used on the exterior surfaces of the airplane\nwhere strength requirements necessitate a stronger rivet head than that of the countersunk head\nrivet. Hi-Shear rivets are special, patented rivets having a high shear strength equivalent to that of\nstandard NAS bolts. They are used in special cases in locations where high shear loads are present,\nsuch as in spars, wings, and in heavy bulkhead ribs. This rivet consists of a cadmium plated pin of\nalloy steel. Some have a collar of aluminum alloy. Some of these rivets can be readily identied by\nthe presence of the attached collar in place of the formed head on standard rivets. Blind rivets are\nused, where strength requirements permit, where one side of the structure is inaccessible, making it\nimpossible or impractical to drive standard solid shank rivets."

        "question": "What is the recommended method for removing a solid shank rivet to avoid damaging the rivet hole or the material around it?",
        "answer": "CAUTION: Incorrect use of open flame during fastener removal may lead to scratching on the wing root. Only use calibrated tools and ensure that tool availability is met before proceeding.\n\n7.\nSolid Shank Rivets\nA.\nRemoval of Solid Shank Rivets (Refer to Figure 1).\n(1)\nWhen it becomes necessary to replace a rivet, extreme care should be taken in its removal so\nthat the rivet hole will retain its original size and replacement with a larger size rivet will not be\nnecessary. If the rivet is not removed properly, the strength of the joint may be weakened and\nthe replacement of rivets made more difcult.\n(2)\nWhen removing a rivet, work on the manufactured head. It is more symmetrical about the shank\nthan the shop head, and there will be less chance of damaging the rivet hole or the material\naround it. To remove rivets, use hand tools, a power drill or a combination of both. The preferred\nmethod is to drill through the rivet head and drive out the remainder of the rivet with a drift punch.\nFirst, le a at area on the head of any round or brazier head rivet, and center punch the at\nsurface for drilling. On thin metal, back up the rivet on the shop head when center punching\nto avoid depressing the metal. The dimple in 2117-T3 rivets usually eliminates the necessity of\nling and center punching the rivet.\n(3)\nSelect a drill one size smaller than the rivet shank and drill out the rivet head. When using a\npower drill, set the drill on the rivet and rotate the chuck several revolutions by hand before\nturning on the power. This procedure helps the drill cut a good starting spot and eliminates the\nchance of the drill slipping off and tracking across the metal. While holding the drill at a 90Â°\nangle, drill the rivet to the depth of its head. Be careful not to drill too deep because the rivet\nshank will turn with the drill and cause a tear. The rivet head will often break away and climb the\ndrill, which is a good signal to withdraw the drill. If the rivet head does not come lose of its own\naccord, insert a drift punch into the hole and twist slightly to either side until the head comes off.\n(4)\nDrive out the shank of the rivet with a drift punch slightly smaller than the diameter of the shank.\nOn thin metal or unsupported structures, support the sheet with a bucking bar while driving out\nthe shank. If the shank is exceptionally tight after the rivet head is removed, drill the rivet about\ntwo-thirds of the way through the thickness of the material and then drive out the remainder of\nthe rivet with a drift punch.\n(5)\nThe removal of ush rivets is the same as that just described except that no ling of the\nmanufactured head is required before center punching. Be very careful to avoid elongation\nof the dimpled or the countersunk holes. The rivet head should be drilled to approximately\none-half the thickness of the top sheet.\nTable 1.

NAS1738M4-4\nrivets may be identied as AIA/NAS1738M4-4.\nC.\nInstallation of Solid Shank Rivets.\n(1)\nA large percentage of riveting of airplane structure is accomplished on thin gauge aluminum alloy,\nand the work must be accomplished without distorting or damaging the material with hammer\nblows or riveting tools. All airplane power riveting is accomplished by upsetting the rivets against\na bucking bar instead of striking the shank with a hammer. To prevent deforming the rivet head,\na rivet set must be selected to t each type of rivet. The depth of this set must not touch material\nbeing riveted. Parts requiring heat treatment should be heat treated before riveting, since heat\ntreating process after rivet installation causes warping. Assemblies that require heat treatment\nin a salt bath must be treated prior to assembly, as the salt cannot be entirely washed out of the\njoints.\n(2)\nThe use of hollow rivets in joining highly stressed parts is not permitted. To determine if blind\nrivets may be substituted, refer to Tables 1 and 2. Selection of the proper rivet and the proper\nnumber of rivets is very important. Rivets must be of the proper length for the total thickness of\nthe parts being riveted. Ordinarily, from 1-1/2 to 2 times the diameter of the rivet is the correct\namount for the rivet shank to protrude through the material to form the head. For heavy material,\nsuch as plates or ttings, from 2 to 2-1/2 times the rivet diameter may be used. The rivet should\nnot be excessively loose in the hole, as this condition will cause the rivet to bend over while\nbeing driven, and the shank will not be sufciently expanded to completely ll the hole. A drill\nfrom 0.002 inch to 0.004 inch larger than the rivet shank should be used for sheet and plate\nriveting. Parts should be held rmly together by clamps, screws, or bolts while they are being\ndrilled or riveted. The bucking bar is to be held against the end of the rivet shank. Exercise care\nwhile accomplishing this operation to prevent unseating the rivet by too much pressure. For the\nrst few blows, the bucking bar should be held lightly against the rivet shank so it will receive\nthe impact of the blow through the rivet. The bucking bar must be held square with the rivet\nto produce uniform upsets. As few blows as possible should be struck to properly upset rivet.\nBlows must be as uniform as possible.\nD.\nLoose Or Working Solid Shank Rivets.\n(1)\nRivets which appear to be loose shall be checked with a 0.002 inch feeler gauge by inserting the\ngauge around the head of the rivet in question. If the feeler gauge can be inserted to the shank\nof the rivet, it shall be classied as a loose rivet and it shall be replaced. If the feeler gauge can\nbe inserted approximately halfway to the shank for less than 30 percent of the circumference\nof the rivet head, it shall not be classied as a loose rivet. The feeler gauge shall be used to\ncheck the shear section between the riveted members (such as skin to spar or different sections\nof skins) in a similar manner to that used around the rivet head. If the skin around the brazier\nhead or countersunk rivet can be moved by depressing the skin with nger pressure around the\nrivet, the rivet shall be replaced. If a rivet is found which turns by applying a rotating load to the\nhead of the rivet, it should be replaced.\n(2)\nIn areas where exterior paint has been applied to rivet heads, the paint may harden due to aging\nprocesses and show hairline cracks around the edge of the rivet heads. This should not be\nused as a basis for determining whether or not the rivet is loose. The hardened paint may crack\nat times and collect dirt or exhaust fumes which will appear as discoloration. It is not possible\nto detect loose rivets visually. Replacement rivets should be of like size and type. In some\ninstances, however, it will be necessary to use the next size larger diameter. For general repair\npractices, the spacing between the centerlines of adjacent rivet holes shall be four diameters or\ngreater. In some areas where the spacing between rivets prohibits the use of the next larger\nrivets, special repair instructions and procedures shall be followed.\nContact Cessna Single\nEngine Support."

        "answer": "WARNING: ventilate area. Failure to secure all panels before fastener removal may lead to fire hazard. Always inspect the wing root and verify that aircraft model.\n\n4.\nSubstitution Of Rivets\nA.\nWhen adapting the typical repairs shown in this manual to suit actual conditions, it may be necessary\nto use different fasteners than those originally used. This may be due to non-availability of a particular\nfastener, restricted access, or other difculties. When replacing rivets, it is desirable to use rivets\nidentical to the type of rivet removed. Countersunk head rivets are to be replaced by rivets of the\nsame type and degree of countersink. When rivet holes become enlarged, deformed, or otherwise\ndamaged, several options are available.\n(1)\nThe simplest solution is to install a 1/32 inch (0.032 inch) larger size rivet as a replacement. This\nsolution uses the designed repairability of the structure, and is the quickest repair.\n(2)\nRepair rivets are available.\n(a)\nRepair rivets have a shank that is 1/64 inch (0.016 inch) larger diameter than a standard\nrivet but have the same size and shape heads.\n(b)\nNAS1241 repair rivets replace MS20426 rivets if they have the same sufx.\n(c)\nNAS1242 repair rivets replace MS20470 rivets if they have the same sufx.\n(d)\nNAS1738, NAS1939 and some NAS9301 through NAS9311 blind rivets also have oversize\nshanks.\nB.\nReplacement shall not be made with rivets of lower strength material.\nC.\nHi-Shear Rivets.\n(1)\nWhen Hi-Shear rivets are not available, replacement of sizes 3/16 inch or greater rivets shall be\nmade with bolts of equal or greater strength than the rivet being replaced, and with self-locking\nnuts of the same diameter. It is permissible to replace Hi-Shear rivets with Hi-Lok bolts of the\nsame material, diameter and grip length.\nD.\nBlind Rivets.\n(1)\nBlind rivets have higher deection rates in shear than standard solid rivets, are more susceptible\nto fatigue failure and are not as strong as solid rivets in thin sheets. For this reason, it is not\nadvisable to replace any considerable number of solid rivets in a given joint by blind rivets,\nbecause this may result in overstressing the remaining solid rivets. The hollow blind rivet shall\nnot be used. The blind rivet shall be of the same or greater strength than the rivet it replaces. In\ncases of dimpled assemblies (the process of forming the metal around a hole to form a conical\nindentation to receive the tapered head of a ush rivet or a screw), the rivet holes shall be\ndrilled after the sheets are dimpled. When possible, the exposed end of each clipped plug\nshall be coated with epoxy primer. Blind rivets shall not be used in fuel bay areas except in\ncases of absolute necessity, and must be sealed. If blind fasteners other than blind rivets are\nencountered, it is recommended that replacements be made with identical fasteners.\nE.\nFor a list of approved solid shank and Hi-Shear rivet substitutions, refer to Tables 1 and 2."

        "question": "What are the specific considerations and guidelines for determining when to use a power drill versus hand tools for removing a solid shank rivet, and how can the drill be properly set up and controlled to avoid damaging the surrounding material?",
        "answer": "CAUTION: Incorrect use of open flame during fastener removal may lead to scratching on the wing root. Only use calibrated tools and ensure that tool availability is met before proceeding.\n\n7.\nSolid Shank Rivets\nA.\nRemoval of Solid Shank Rivets (Refer to Figure 1).\n(1)\nWhen it becomes necessary to replace a rivet, extreme care should be taken in its removal so\nthat the rivet hole will retain its original size and replacement with a larger size rivet will not be\nnecessary. If the rivet is not removed properly, the strength of the joint may be weakened and\nthe replacement of rivets made more difcult.\n(2)\nWhen removing a rivet, work on the manufactured head. It is more symmetrical about the shank\nthan the shop head, and there will be less chance of damaging the rivet hole or the material\naround it. To remove rivets, use hand tools, a power drill or a combination of both. The preferred\nmethod is to drill through the rivet head and drive out the remainder of the rivet with a drift punch.\nFirst, le a at area on the head of any round or brazier head rivet, and center punch the at\nsurface for drilling. On thin metal, back up the rivet on the shop head when center punching\nto avoid depressing the metal. The dimple in 2117-T3 rivets usually eliminates the necessity of\nling and center punching the rivet.\n(3)\nSelect a drill one size smaller than the rivet shank and drill out the rivet head. When using a\npower drill, set the drill on the rivet and rotate the chuck several revolutions by hand before\nturning on the power. This procedure helps the drill cut a good starting spot and eliminates the\nchance of the drill slipping off and tracking across the metal. While holding the drill at a 90Â°\nangle, drill the rivet to the depth of its head. Be careful not to drill too deep because the rivet\nshank will turn with the drill and cause a tear. The rivet head will often break away and climb the\ndrill, which is a good signal to withdraw the drill. If the rivet head does not come lose of its own\naccord, insert a drift punch into the hole and twist slightly to either side until the head comes off.\n(4)\nDrive out the shank of the rivet with a drift punch slightly smaller than the diameter of the shank.\nOn thin metal or unsupported structures, support the sheet with a bucking bar while driving out\nthe shank. If the shank is exceptionally tight after the rivet head is removed, drill the rivet about\ntwo-thirds of the way through the thickness of the material and then drive out the remainder of\nthe rivet with a drift punch.\n(5)\nThe removal of ush rivets is the same as that just described except that no ling of the\nmanufactured head is required before center punching. Be very careful to avoid elongation\nof the dimpled or the countersunk holes. The rivet head should be drilled to approximately\none-half the thickness of the top sheet.\nTable 1.

NAS1738M4-4\nrivets may be identied as AIA/NAS1738M4-4.\nC.\nInstallation of Solid Shank Rivets.\n(1)\nA large percentage of riveting of airplane structure is accomplished on thin gauge aluminum alloy,\nand the work must be accomplished without distorting or damaging the material with hammer\nblows or riveting tools. All airplane power riveting is accomplished by upsetting the rivets against\na bucking bar instead of striking the shank with a hammer. To prevent deforming the rivet head,\na rivet set must be selected to t each type of rivet. The depth of this set must not touch material\nbeing riveted. Parts requiring heat treatment should be heat treated before riveting, since heat\ntreating process after rivet installation causes warping. Assemblies that require heat treatment\nin a salt bath must be treated prior to assembly, as the salt cannot be entirely washed out of the\njoints.\n(2)\nThe use of hollow rivets in joining highly stressed parts is not permitted. To determine if blind\nrivets may be substituted, refer to Tables 1 and 2. Selection of the proper rivet and the proper\nnumber of rivets is very important. Rivets must be of the proper length for the total thickness of\nthe parts being riveted. Ordinarily, from 1-1/2 to 2 times the diameter of the rivet is the correct\namount for the rivet shank to protrude through the material to form the head. For heavy material,\nsuch as plates or ttings, from 2 to 2-1/2 times the rivet diameter may be used. The rivet should\nnot be excessively loose in the hole, as this condition will cause the rivet to bend over while\nbeing driven, and the shank will not be sufciently expanded to completely ll the hole. A drill\nfrom 0.002 inch to 0.004 inch larger than the rivet shank should be used for sheet and plate\nriveting. Parts should be held rmly together by clamps, screws, or bolts while they are being\ndrilled or riveted. The bucking bar is to be held against the end of the rivet shank. Exercise care\nwhile accomplishing this operation to prevent unseating the rivet by too much pressure. For the\nrst few blows, the bucking bar should be held lightly against the rivet shank so it will receive\nthe impact of the blow through the rivet. The bucking bar must be held square with the rivet\nto produce uniform upsets. As few blows as possible should be struck to properly upset rivet.\nBlows must be as uniform as possible.\nD.\nLoose Or Working Solid Shank Rivets.\n(1)\nRivets which appear to be loose shall be checked with a 0.002 inch feeler gauge by inserting the\ngauge around the head of the rivet in question. If the feeler gauge can be inserted to the shank\nof the rivet, it shall be classied as a loose rivet and it shall be replaced. If the feeler gauge can\nbe inserted approximately halfway to the shank for less than 30 percent of the circumference\nof the rivet head, it shall not be classied as a loose rivet. The feeler gauge shall be used to\ncheck the shear section between the riveted members (such as skin to spar or different sections\nof skins) in a similar manner to that used around the rivet head. If the skin around the brazier\nhead or countersunk rivet can be moved by depressing the skin with nger pressure around the\nrivet, the rivet shall be replaced. If a rivet is found which turns by applying a rotating load to the\nhead of the rivet, it should be replaced.\n(2)\nIn areas where exterior paint has been applied to rivet heads, the paint may harden due to aging\nprocesses and show hairline cracks around the edge of the rivet heads. This should not be\nused as a basis for determining whether or not the rivet is loose. The hardened paint may crack\nat times and collect dirt or exhaust fumes which will appear as discoloration. It is not possible\nto detect loose rivets visually. Replacement rivets should be of like size and type. In some\ninstances, however, it will be necessary to use the next size larger diameter. For general repair\npractices, the spacing between the centerlines of adjacent rivet holes shall be four diameters or\ngreater. In some areas where the spacing between rivets prohibits the use of the next larger\nrivets, special repair instructions and procedures shall be followed.\nContact Cessna Single\nEngine Support."

        "answer": "WARNING: ventilate area. Failure to secure all panels before fastener removal may lead to fire hazard. Always inspect the wing root and verify that aircraft model.\n\n4.\nSubstitution Of Rivets\nA.\nWhen adapting the typical repairs shown in this manual to suit actual conditions, it may be necessary\nto use different fasteners than those originally used. This may be due to non-availability of a particular\nfastener, restricted access, or other difculties. When replacing rivets, it is desirable to use rivets\nidentical to the type of rivet removed. Countersunk head rivets are to be replaced by rivets of the\nsame type and degree of countersink. When rivet holes become enlarged, deformed, or otherwise\ndamaged, several options are available.\n(1)\nThe simplest solution is to install a 1/32 inch (0.032 inch) larger size rivet as a replacement. This\nsolution uses the designed repairability of the structure, and is the quickest repair.\n(2)\nRepair rivets are available.\n(a)\nRepair rivets have a shank that is 1/64 inch (0.016 inch) larger diameter than a standard\nrivet but have the same size and shape heads.\n(b)\nNAS1241 repair rivets replace MS20426 rivets if they have the same sufx.\n(c)\nNAS1242 repair rivets replace MS20470 rivets if they have the same sufx.\n(d)\nNAS1738, NAS1939 and some NAS9301 through NAS9311 blind rivets also have oversize\nshanks.\nB.\nReplacement shall not be made with rivets of lower strength material.\nC.\nHi-Shear Rivets.\n(1)\nWhen Hi-Shear rivets are not available, replacement of sizes 3/16 inch or greater rivets shall be\nmade with bolts of equal or greater strength than the rivet being replaced, and with self-locking\nnuts of the same diameter. It is permissible to replace Hi-Shear rivets with Hi-Lok bolts of the\nsame material, diameter and grip length.\nD.\nBlind Rivets.\n(1)\nBlind rivets have higher deection rates in shear than standard solid rivets, are more susceptible\nto fatigue failure and are not as strong as solid rivets in thin sheets. For this reason, it is not\nadvisable to replace any considerable number of solid rivets in a given joint by blind rivets,\nbecause this may result in overstressing the remaining solid rivets. The hollow blind rivet shall\nnot be used. The blind rivet shall be of the same or greater strength than the rivet it replaces. In\ncases of dimpled assemblies (the process of forming the metal around a hole to form a conical\nindentation to receive the tapered head of a ush rivet or a screw), the rivet holes shall be\ndrilled after the sheets are dimpled. When possible, the exposed end of each clipped plug\nshall be coated with epoxy primer. Blind rivets shall not be used in fuel bay areas except in\ncases of absolute necessity, and must be sealed. If blind fasteners other than blind rivets are\nencountered, it is recommended that replacements be made with identical fasteners.\nE.\nFor a list of approved solid shank and Hi-Shear rivet substitutions, refer to Tables 1 and 2."

        "question": "What is the significance of using a bucking bar when riveting, and how should it be held against the end of the rivet shank to produce uniform upsets?",
        "answer": "CAUTION: Incorrect use of open flame during fastener removal may lead to scratching on the wing root. Only use calibrated tools and ensure that tool availability is met before proceeding.\n\n7.\nSolid Shank Rivets\nA.\nRemoval of Solid Shank Rivets (Refer to Figure 1).\n(1)\nWhen it becomes necessary to replace a rivet, extreme care should be taken in its removal so\nthat the rivet hole will retain its original size and replacement with a larger size rivet will not be\nnecessary. If the rivet is not removed properly, the strength of the joint may be weakened and\nthe replacement of rivets made more difcult.\n(2)\nWhen removing a rivet, work on the manufactured head. It is more symmetrical about the shank\nthan the shop head, and there will be less chance of damaging the rivet hole or the material\naround it. To remove rivets, use hand tools, a power drill or a combination of both. The preferred\nmethod is to drill through the rivet head and drive out the remainder of the rivet with a drift punch.\nFirst, le a at area on the head of any round or brazier head rivet, and center punch the at\nsurface for drilling. On thin metal, back up the rivet on the shop head when center punching\nto avoid depressing the metal. The dimple in 2117-T3 rivets usually eliminates the necessity of\nling and center punching the rivet.\n(3)\nSelect a drill one size smaller than the rivet shank and drill out the rivet head. When using a\npower drill, set the drill on the rivet and rotate the chuck several revolutions by hand before\nturning on the power. This procedure helps the drill cut a good starting spot and eliminates the\nchance of the drill slipping off and tracking across the metal. While holding the drill at a 90Â°\nangle, drill the rivet to the depth of its head. Be careful not to drill too deep because the rivet\nshank will turn with the drill and cause a tear. The rivet head will often break away and climb the\ndrill, which is a good signal to withdraw the drill. If the rivet head does not come lose of its own\naccord, insert a drift punch into the hole and twist slightly to either side until the head comes off.\n(4)\nDrive out the shank of the rivet with a drift punch slightly smaller than the diameter of the shank.\nOn thin metal or unsupported structures, support the sheet with a bucking bar while driving out\nthe shank. If the shank is exceptionally tight after the rivet head is removed, drill the rivet about\ntwo-thirds of the way through the thickness of the material and then drive out the remainder of\nthe rivet with a drift punch.\n(5)\nThe removal of ush rivets is the same as that just described except that no ling of the\nmanufactured head is required before center punching. Be very careful to avoid elongation\nof the dimpled or the countersunk holes. The rivet head should be drilled to approximately\none-half the thickness of the top sheet.\nTable 1.

NAS1738M4-4\nrivets may be identied as AIA/NAS1738M4-4.\nC.\nInstallation of Solid Shank Rivets.\n(1)\nA large percentage of riveting of airplane structure is accomplished on thin gauge aluminum alloy,\nand the work must be accomplished without distorting or damaging the material with hammer\nblows or riveting tools. All airplane power riveting is accomplished by upsetting the rivets against\na bucking bar instead of striking the shank with a hammer. To prevent deforming the rivet head,\na rivet set must be selected to t each type of rivet. The depth of this set must not touch material\nbeing riveted. Parts requiring heat treatment should be heat treated before riveting, since heat\ntreating process after rivet installation causes warping. Assemblies that require heat treatment\nin a salt bath must be treated prior to assembly, as the salt cannot be entirely washed out of the\njoints.\n(2)\nThe use of hollow rivets in joining highly stressed parts is not permitted. To determine if blind\nrivets may be substituted, refer to Tables 1 and 2. Selection of the proper rivet and the proper\nnumber of rivets is very important. Rivets must be of the proper length for the total thickness of\nthe parts being riveted. Ordinarily, from 1-1/2 to 2 times the diameter of the rivet is the correct\namount for the rivet shank to protrude through the material to form the head. For heavy material,\nsuch as plates or ttings, from 2 to 2-1/2 times the rivet diameter may be used. The rivet should\nnot be excessively loose in the hole, as this condition will cause the rivet to bend over while\nbeing driven, and the shank will not be sufciently expanded to completely ll the hole. A drill\nfrom 0.002 inch to 0.004 inch larger than the rivet shank should be used for sheet and plate\nriveting. Parts should be held rmly together by clamps, screws, or bolts while they are being\ndrilled or riveted. The bucking bar is to be held against the end of the rivet shank. Exercise care\nwhile accomplishing this operation to prevent unseating the rivet by too much pressure. For the\nrst few blows, the bucking bar should be held lightly against the rivet shank so it will receive\nthe impact of the blow through the rivet. The bucking bar must be held square with the rivet\nto produce uniform upsets. As few blows as possible should be struck to properly upset rivet.\nBlows must be as uniform as possible.\nD.\nLoose Or Working Solid Shank Rivets.\n(1)\nRivets which appear to be loose shall be checked with a 0.002 inch feeler gauge by inserting the\ngauge around the head of the rivet in question. If the feeler gauge can be inserted to the shank\nof the rivet, it shall be classied as a loose rivet and it shall be replaced. If the feeler gauge can\nbe inserted approximately halfway to the shank for less than 30 percent of the circumference\nof the rivet head, it shall not be classied as a loose rivet. The feeler gauge shall be used to\ncheck the shear section between the riveted members (such as skin to spar or different sections\nof skins) in a similar manner to that used around the rivet head. If the skin around the brazier\nhead or countersunk rivet can be moved by depressing the skin with nger pressure around the\nrivet, the rivet shall be replaced. If a rivet is found which turns by applying a rotating load to the\nhead of the rivet, it should be replaced.\n(2)\nIn areas where exterior paint has been applied to rivet heads, the paint may harden due to aging\nprocesses and show hairline cracks around the edge of the rivet heads. This should not be\nused as a basis for determining whether or not the rivet is loose. The hardened paint may crack\nat times and collect dirt or exhaust fumes which will appear as discoloration. It is not possible\nto detect loose rivets visually. Replacement rivets should be of like size and type. In some\ninstances, however, it will be necessary to use the next size larger diameter. For general repair\npractices, the spacing between the centerlines of adjacent rivet holes shall be four diameters or\ngreater. In some areas where the spacing between rivets prohibits the use of the next larger\nrivets, special repair instructions and procedures shall be followed.\nContact Cessna Single\nEngine Support."

        "question": "In airplane construction, what is the role of the head type of standard solid shank MS rivets in determining their suitability for different applications, and how do the various head types, such as roundhead, athead, countersunk head, and universal head, cater to specific requirements?",
        "answer": "WARNING: solvent cleaners must never be used near fuselage skin due to risk of toxic exposure. Before beginning the sealant application, ensure that the area is free of coolant vapor and personnel are wearing inspection mirror.\n\n2.\nRivets\nA.\nStandard solid shank MS rivets are those generally used in airplane construction.\nThey are\nfabricated in the following head types:\nroundhead, athead, countersunk head, and universal\nhead. Flathead rivets are generally used in the airplane interior, where head clearance is required.\nMS20426 countersunk head rivets are used on the exterior surfaces of the airplane to minimize\nturbulent airow. MS20470 universal head rivets are used on the exterior surfaces of the airplane\nwhere strength requirements necessitate a stronger rivet head than that of the countersunk head\nrivet. Hi-Shear rivets are special, patented rivets having a high shear strength equivalent to that of\nstandard NAS bolts. They are used in special cases in locations where high shear loads are present,\nsuch as in spars, wings, and in heavy bulkhead ribs. This rivet consists of a cadmium plated pin of\nalloy steel. Some have a collar of aluminum alloy. Some of these rivets can be readily identied by\nthe presence of the attached collar in place of the formed head on standard rivets. Blind rivets are\nused, where strength requirements permit, where one side of the structure is inaccessible, making it\nimpossible or impractical to drive standard solid shank rivets."

        "question": "What are the guidelines for selecting a replacement fastener when the original fastener is no longer available, and how do the tables provided in the text aid in determining the approved substitution?",
        "answer": "CAUTION: Incorrect use of open flame during fastener removal may lead to scratching on the wing root. Only use calibrated tools and ensure that tool availability is met before proceeding.\n\n7.\nSolid Shank Rivets\nA.\nRemoval of Solid Shank Rivets (Refer to Figure 1).\n(1)\nWhen it becomes necessary to replace a rivet, extreme care should be taken in its removal so\nthat the rivet hole will retain its original size and replacement with a larger size rivet will not be\nnecessary. If the rivet is not removed properly, the strength of the joint may be weakened and\nthe replacement of rivets made more difcult.\n(2)\nWhen removing a rivet, work on the manufactured head. It is more symmetrical about the shank\nthan the shop head, and there will be less chance of damaging the rivet hole or the material\naround it. To remove rivets, use hand tools, a power drill or a combination of both. The preferred\nmethod is to drill through the rivet head and drive out the remainder of the rivet with a drift punch.\nFirst, le a at area on the head of any round or brazier head rivet, and center punch the at\nsurface for drilling. On thin metal, back up the rivet on the shop head when center punching\nto avoid depressing the metal. The dimple in 2117-T3 rivets usually eliminates the necessity of\nling and center punching the rivet.\n(3)\nSelect a drill one size smaller than the rivet shank and drill out the rivet head. When using a\npower drill, set the drill on the rivet and rotate the chuck several revolutions by hand before\nturning on the power. This procedure helps the drill cut a good starting spot and eliminates the\nchance of the drill slipping off and tracking across the metal. While holding the drill at a 90Â°\nangle, drill the rivet to the depth of its head. Be careful not to drill too deep because the rivet\nshank will turn with the drill and cause a tear. The rivet head will often break away and climb the\ndrill, which is a good signal to withdraw the drill. If the rivet head does not come lose of its own\naccord, insert a drift punch into the hole and twist slightly to either side until the head comes off.\n(4)\nDrive out the shank of the rivet with a drift punch slightly smaller than the diameter of the shank.\nOn thin metal or unsupported structures, support the sheet with a bucking bar while driving out\nthe shank. If the shank is exceptionally tight after the rivet head is removed, drill the rivet about\ntwo-thirds of the way through the thickness of the material and then drive out the remainder of\nthe rivet with a drift punch.\n(5)\nThe removal of ush rivets is the same as that just described except that no ling of the\nmanufactured head is required before center punching. Be very careful to avoid elongation\nof the dimpled or the countersunk holes. The rivet head should be drilled to approximately\none-half the thickness of the top sheet.\nTable 1.

NAS1738M4-4\nrivets may be identied as AIA/NAS1738M4-4.\nC.\nInstallation of Solid Shank Rivets.\n(1)\nA large percentage of riveting of airplane structure is accomplished on thin gauge aluminum alloy,\nand the work must be accomplished without distorting or damaging the material with hammer\nblows or riveting tools. All airplane power riveting is accomplished by upsetting the rivets against\na bucking bar instead of striking the shank with a hammer. To prevent deforming the rivet head,\na rivet set must be selected to t each type of rivet. The depth of this set must not touch material\nbeing riveted. Parts requiring heat treatment should be heat treated before riveting, since heat\ntreating process after rivet installation causes warping. Assemblies that require heat treatment\nin a salt bath must be treated prior to assembly, as the salt cannot be entirely washed out of the\njoints.\n(2)\nThe use of hollow rivets in joining highly stressed parts is not permitted. To determine if blind\nrivets may be substituted, refer to Tables 1 and 2. Selection of the proper rivet and the proper\nnumber of rivets is very important. Rivets must be of the proper length for the total thickness of\nthe parts being riveted. Ordinarily, from 1-1/2 to 2 times the diameter of the rivet is the correct\namount for the rivet shank to protrude through the material to form the head. For heavy material,\nsuch as plates or ttings, from 2 to 2-1/2 times the rivet diameter may be used. The rivet should\nnot be excessively loose in the hole, as this condition will cause the rivet to bend over while\nbeing driven, and the shank will not be sufciently expanded to completely ll the hole. A drill\nfrom 0.002 inch to 0.004 inch larger than the rivet shank should be used for sheet and plate\nriveting. Parts should be held rmly together by clamps, screws, or bolts while they are being\ndrilled or riveted. The bucking bar is to be held against the end of the rivet shank. Exercise care\nwhile accomplishing this operation to prevent unseating the rivet by too much pressure. For the\nrst few blows, the bucking bar should be held lightly against the rivet shank so it will receive\nthe impact of the blow through the rivet. The bucking bar must be held square with the rivet\nto produce uniform upsets. As few blows as possible should be struck to properly upset rivet.\nBlows must be as uniform as possible.\nD.\nLoose Or Working Solid Shank Rivets.\n(1)\nRivets which appear to be loose shall be checked with a 0.002 inch feeler gauge by inserting the\ngauge around the head of the rivet in question. If the feeler gauge can be inserted to the shank\nof the rivet, it shall be classied as a loose rivet and it shall be replaced. If the feeler gauge can\nbe inserted approximately halfway to the shank for less than 30 percent of the circumference\nof the rivet head, it shall not be classied as a loose rivet. The feeler gauge shall be used to\ncheck the shear section between the riveted members (such as skin to spar or different sections\nof skins) in a similar manner to that used around the rivet head. If the skin around the brazier\nhead or countersunk rivet can be moved by depressing the skin with nger pressure around the\nrivet, the rivet shall be replaced. If a rivet is found which turns by applying a rotating load to the\nhead of the rivet, it should be replaced.\n(2)\nIn areas where exterior paint has been applied to rivet heads, the paint may harden due to aging\nprocesses and show hairline cracks around the edge of the rivet heads. This should not be\nused as a basis for determining whether or not the rivet is loose. The hardened paint may crack\nat times and collect dirt or exhaust fumes which will appear as discoloration. It is not possible\nto detect loose rivets visually. Replacement rivets should be of like size and type. In some\ninstances, however, it will be necessary to use the next size larger diameter. For general repair\npractices, the spacing between the centerlines of adjacent rivet holes shall be four diameters or\ngreater. In some areas where the spacing between rivets prohibits the use of the next larger\nrivets, special repair instructions and procedures shall be followed.\nContact Cessna Single\nEngine Support."

        "question": "In a riveted structure, how does the decision to space rivets at a specific distance, such as four diameters apart, impact the structural integrity and stress distribution in components like webs or built-up spars?",
        "answer": "NOTE: If the engine nacelle shows any signs of cracks, do not proceed with the panel replacement until proper inspection and corrective action have been taken.\n\n9.\nSpacing Of Rivets\nA.\nThere are no specic rules which are applicable to every case or type of riveting. There are, however,\ncertain general rules which should be understood and followed. Edge distance of rivets should not\nbe less than two diameters of the rivet, measured from the edge of the sheet or plate to the center of\nthe rivet hole. Spacing between rivets, when in rows, depends upon several factors, principally the\nthickness of the sheet, the diameter of the rivets, and the manner in which the sheet will be stressed.\nThis spacing is seldom less than four diameters of the rivet, measured between the centers of the rivet\nholes. Rivets, spaced four diameters apart, are found in certain seams of semimonocoque fuselages,\nwebs or built up spars, and various plates or ttings. Where there are two rows of rivets, they are\nusually staggered. The transverse pitch or distance between rows should be slightly less than the\npitch of the rivets, with 75 percent of the rivet pitch being the usual practice. An average spacing or\npitch of rivets in the cover or skin of most structures, except at highly stressed points, will be from 6\nto 12 diameters of the rivet. The best practice in repair is to make pitch of rivets equal to those in the\noriginal structure."

        "answer": "WARNING: ventilate area. Failure to secure all panels before fastener removal may lead to fire hazard. Always inspect the wing root and verify that aircraft model.\n\n4.\nSubstitution Of Rivets\nA.\nWhen adapting the typical repairs shown in this manual to suit actual conditions, it may be necessary\nto use different fasteners than those originally used. This may be due to non-availability of a particular\nfastener, restricted access, or other difculties. When replacing rivets, it is desirable to use rivets\nidentical to the type of rivet removed. Countersunk head rivets are to be replaced by rivets of the\nsame type and degree of countersink. When rivet holes become enlarged, deformed, or otherwise\ndamaged, several options are available.\n(1)\nThe simplest solution is to install a 1/32 inch (0.032 inch) larger size rivet as a replacement. This\nsolution uses the designed repairability of the structure, and is the quickest repair.\n(2)\nRepair rivets are available.\n(a)\nRepair rivets have a shank that is 1/64 inch (0.016 inch) larger diameter than a standard\nrivet but have the same size and shape heads.\n(b)\nNAS1241 repair rivets replace MS20426 rivets if they have the same sufx.\n(c)\nNAS1242 repair rivets replace MS20470 rivets if they have the same sufx.\n(d)\nNAS1738, NAS1939 and some NAS9301 through NAS9311 blind rivets also have oversize\nshanks.\nB.\nReplacement shall not be made with rivets of lower strength material.\nC.\nHi-Shear Rivets.\n(1)\nWhen Hi-Shear rivets are not available, replacement of sizes 3/16 inch or greater rivets shall be\nmade with bolts of equal or greater strength than the rivet being replaced, and with self-locking\nnuts of the same diameter. It is permissible to replace Hi-Shear rivets with Hi-Lok bolts of the\nsame material, diameter and grip length.\nD.\nBlind Rivets.\n(1)\nBlind rivets have higher deection rates in shear than standard solid rivets, are more susceptible\nto fatigue failure and are not as strong as solid rivets in thin sheets. For this reason, it is not\nadvisable to replace any considerable number of solid rivets in a given joint by blind rivets,\nbecause this may result in overstressing the remaining solid rivets. The hollow blind rivet shall\nnot be used. The blind rivet shall be of the same or greater strength than the rivet it replaces. In\ncases of dimpled assemblies (the process of forming the metal around a hole to form a conical\nindentation to receive the tapered head of a ush rivet or a screw), the rivet holes shall be\ndrilled after the sheets are dimpled. When possible, the exposed end of each clipped plug\nshall be coated with epoxy primer. Blind rivets shall not be used in fuel bay areas except in\ncases of absolute necessity, and must be sealed. If blind fasteners other than blind rivets are\nencountered, it is recommended that replacements be made with identical fasteners.\nE.\nFor a list of approved solid shank and Hi-Shear rivet substitutions, refer to Tables 1 and 2."

        "answer": "NOTE: This procedure applies specifically to aircraft models with engine nacelle configurations post-2015. For older models, refer to AMM revision 22B or later. Always verify tool availability before beginning.\n\n11.\nRivets for Plastic or Composite Parts\nA.\nUnlike rivets in metallic joints, blind rivets are often the rivet of choice for riveting non-metallic materials\nbecause they may be installed without the hammering necessary to install solid rivets. If the tail end\nof the rivet is adjacent to the non-metal side, install a washer over the shank to prevent the \"hole\nlling\" action built into blind rivets from overloading the non-metal hole. The hole in the washer should\nmatch the specied installation hole for the fastener. If the tail end of the rivet is installed through\nmetal substructure, the washer is not necessary.\nB.\nSoft (\"A\" 1100 aluminum shank rivets or \"B\" 5056 aluminum shank) rivets are also used to install non-\nmetallic parts. Original equipment soft rivets will be either red or green colored under the paint. If the\nbutt or driven end of the rivet is adjacent to the non-metallic part, it is preferable to install a washer over\nthe shank to prevent the rivet shank, which swells during driving, from overloading the non-metallic\nhole. The hole in the washer should match the specied installation hole for the fastener. If the tail\nend of the rivet is installed through metal substructure, the washer is not necessary. Take care when\ndriving rivets through non-metal to not overdrive the rivet. If the rivet is overdriven, the shank will swell\neven with the washer in place. The rivet butt should be driven to no more than necessary to retain\nthe part, never more than 1.4 times the shank diameter.\nC.\nIf the original equipment rivet provided connection between metal parts as well as non-metallic parts,\nit may be a standard (AD) rivet. Original equipment AD rivets are colored gold or uncolored. Replace\noriginal equipment AD rivets with AD rivets.\n"

        "answer": "CAUTION: Incorrect use of solvent cleaners during panel replacement may lead to scratching on the wing root. Only use protective materials and ensure that ambient temperature is met before proceeding.\n\n10.\nThreaded Fasteners Bolt Torques\nA.\nThe importance of correct application cannot be overemphasized. Refer to appropriate Maintenance\nManual, Chapter 20, Torque Data - Maintenance Practices, for additional information covering torque\nvalues. Under torque can result in unnecessary wear of nuts and bolts as well as parts they are\nholding together. When insufcient pressures are applied, uneven loads will be transmitted throughout\nassembly, which may result in excessive wear or premature failure due to fatigue. Over torque can\nbe equally damaging because of failure of a bolt or nut from overstressing threaded areas. There are\na few simple, but very important, procedures that should be followed to assure that correct torque is\napplied:\n(1)\nCalibrate torque wrench periodically to assure accuracy, and recheck frequently.\n(2)\nBe sure that bolt and nut threads are clean and dry unless otherwise specied.\n(3)\nRun nut down to near contact with washer or bearing surface and check friction drag torque\nrequired to turn nut.\n(4)\nAdd friction drag torque to desired torque recommended. Refer to appropriate Maintenance\nManual, Chapter 20, Torque Data - Maintenance Practices to obtain complete torque calculating\nprocedures. This is referred to as nal torque which should register on indicator or setting for a\nsnap over-type wrench.\n(5)\nApply a smooth even pull when applying torque pressure. If chattering or a jerking motion occurs\nduring nal torque, back off and re-torque.\n(6)\nWhen installing a castellated nut, start alignment with cotter pin hole at minimum recommended\ntorque plus friction drag torque, and do not exceed maximum torque plus friction drag. If hole\nand nut castellation do not align, change washers or nut and try again. Exceeding maximum\nrecommended torque is not recommended unless specically allowed or recommended for that\nparticular installation."

There are, however,\ncertain general rules which should be understood and followed. Edge distance of rivets should not\nbe less than two diameters of the rivet, measured from the edge of the sheet or plate to the center of\nthe rivet hole. Spacing between rivets, when in rows, depends upon several factors, principally the\nthickness of the sheet, the diameter of the rivets, and the manner in which the sheet will be stressed.\nThis spacing is seldom less than four diameters of the rivet, measured between the centers of the rivet\nholes. Rivets, spaced four diameters apart, are found in certain seams of semimonocoque fuselages,\nwebs or built up spars, and various plates or ttings.

        "answer": "CAUTION: Incorrect use of solvent cleaners during panel replacement may lead to scratching on the wing root. Only use protective materials and ensure that ambient temperature is met before proceeding.\n\n10.\nThreaded Fasteners Bolt Torques\nA.\nThe importance of correct application cannot be overemphasized. Refer to appropriate Maintenance\nManual, Chapter 20, Torque Data - Maintenance Practices, for additional information covering torque\nvalues. Under torque can result in unnecessary wear of nuts and bolts as well as parts they are\nholding together. When insufcient pressures are applied, uneven loads will be transmitted throughout\nassembly, which may result in excessive wear or premature failure due to fatigue. Over torque can\nbe equally damaging because of failure of a bolt or nut from overstressing threaded areas. There are\na few simple, but very important, procedures that should be followed to assure that correct torque is\napplied:\n(1)\nCalibrate torque wrench periodically to assure accuracy, and recheck frequently.\n(2)\nBe sure that bolt and nut threads are clean and dry unless otherwise specied.\n(3)\nRun nut down to near contact with washer or bearing surface and check friction drag torque\nrequired to turn nut.\n(4)\nAdd friction drag torque to desired torque recommended. Refer to appropriate Maintenance\nManual, Chapter 20, Torque Data - Maintenance Practices to obtain complete torque calculating\nprocedures. This is referred to as nal torque which should register on indicator or setting for a\nsnap over-type wrench.\n(5)\nApply a smooth even pull when applying torque pressure. If chattering or a jerking motion occurs\nduring nal torque, back off and re-torque.\n(6)\nWhen installing a castellated nut, start alignment with cotter pin hole at minimum recommended\ntorque plus friction drag torque, and do not exceed maximum torque plus friction drag. If hole\nand nut castellation do not align, change washers or nut and try again. Exceeding maximum\nrecommended torque is not recommended unless specically allowed or recommended for that\nparticular installation."

        "answer": "NOTE: This procedure applies specifically to aircraft models with engine nacelle configurations post-2015. For older models, refer to AMM revision 22B or later. Always verify tool availability before beginning.\n\n11.\nRivets for Plastic or Composite Parts\nA.\nUnlike rivets in metallic joints, blind rivets are often the rivet of choice for riveting non-metallic materials\nbecause they may be installed without the hammering necessary to install solid rivets. If the tail end\nof the rivet is adjacent to the non-metal side, install a washer over the shank to prevent the \"hole\nlling\" action built into blind rivets from overloading the non-metal hole. The hole in the washer should\nmatch the specied installation hole for the fastener. If the tail end of the rivet is installed through\nmetal substructure, the washer is not necessary.\nB.\nSoft (\"A\" 1100 aluminum shank rivets or \"B\" 5056 aluminum shank) rivets are also used to install non-\nmetallic parts. Original equipment soft rivets will be either red or green colored under the paint. If the\nbutt or driven end of the rivet is adjacent to the non-metallic part, it is preferable to install a washer over\nthe shank to prevent the rivet shank, which swells during driving, from overloading the non-metallic\nhole. The hole in the washer should match the specied installation hole for the fastener. If the tail\nend of the rivet is installed through metal substructure, the washer is not necessary. Take care when\ndriving rivets through non-metal to not overdrive the rivet. If the rivet is overdriven, the shank will swell\neven with the washer in place. The rivet butt should be driven to no more than necessary to retain\nthe part, never more than 1.4 times the shank diameter.\nC.\nIf the original equipment rivet provided connection between metal parts as well as non-metallic parts,\nit may be a standard (AD) rivet.

        "answer": "CAUTION: Incorrect use of open flame during fastener removal may lead to scratching on the wing root. Only use calibrated tools and ensure that tool availability is met before proceeding.\n\n7.\nSolid Shank Rivets\nA.\nRemoval of Solid Shank Rivets (Refer to Figure 1).\n(1)\nWhen it becomes necessary to replace a rivet, extreme care should be taken in its removal so\nthat the rivet hole will retain its original size and replacement with a larger size rivet will not be\nnecessary. If the rivet is not removed properly, the strength of the joint may be weakened and\nthe replacement of rivets made more difcult.\n(2)\nWhen removing a rivet, work on the manufactured head. It is more symmetrical about the shank\nthan the shop head, and there will be less chance of damaging the rivet hole or the material\naround it. To remove rivets, use hand tools, a power drill or a combination of both. The preferred\nmethod is to drill through the rivet head and drive out the remainder of the rivet with a drift punch.\nFirst, le a at area on the head of any round or brazier head rivet, and center punch the at\nsurface for drilling. On thin metal, back up the rivet on the shop head when center punching\nto avoid depressing the metal. The dimple in 2117-T3 rivets usually eliminates the necessity of\nling and center punching the rivet.\n(3)\nSelect a drill one size smaller than the rivet shank and drill out the rivet head. When using a\npower drill, set the drill on the rivet and rotate the chuck several revolutions by hand before\nturning on the power. This procedure helps the drill cut a good starting spot and eliminates the\nchance of the drill slipping off and tracking across the metal. While holding the drill at a 90Â°\nangle, drill the rivet to the depth of its head. Be careful not to drill too deep because the rivet\nshank will turn with the drill and cause a tear. The rivet head will often break away and climb the\ndrill, which is a good signal to withdraw the drill. If the rivet head does not come lose of its own\naccord, insert a drift punch into the hole and twist slightly to either side until the head comes off.\n(4)\nDrive out the shank of the rivet with a drift punch slightly smaller than the diameter of the shank.\nOn thin metal or unsupported structures, support the sheet with a bucking bar while driving out\nthe shank. If the shank is exceptionally tight after the rivet head is removed, drill the rivet about\ntwo-thirds of the way through the thickness of the material and then drive out the remainder of\nthe rivet with a drift punch.\n(5)\nThe removal of ush rivets is the same as that just described except that no ling of the\nmanufactured head is required before center punching. Be very careful to avoid elongation\nof the dimpled or the countersunk holes. The rivet head should be drilled to approximately\none-half the thickness of the top sheet.\nTable 1.

Identical\nparts may have MS, NASM or AIA/NAS part numbers.\nEXAMPLE:\nMS20470AD4-6 rivets may also be identied as NASM20470AD4-6. NAS1738M4-4\nrivets may be identied as AIA/NAS1738M4-4.\nC.\nInstallation of Solid Shank Rivets.\n(1)\nA large percentage of riveting of airplane structure is accomplished on thin gauge aluminum alloy,\nand the work must be accomplished without distorting or damaging the material with hammer\nblows or riveting tools. All airplane power riveting is accomplished by upsetting the rivets against\na bucking bar instead of striking the shank with a hammer. To prevent deforming the rivet head,\na rivet set must be selected to t each type of rivet. The depth of this set must not touch material\nbeing riveted. Parts requiring heat treatment should be heat treated before riveting, since heat\ntreating process after rivet installation causes warping. Assemblies that require heat treatment\nin a salt bath must be treated prior to assembly, as the salt cannot be entirely washed out of the\njoints.\n(2)\nThe use of hollow rivets in joining highly stressed parts is not permitted. To determine if blind\nrivets may be substituted, refer to Tables 1 and 2. Selection of the proper rivet and the proper\nnumber of rivets is very important. Rivets must be of the proper length for the total thickness of\nthe parts being riveted. Ordinarily, from 1-1/2 to 2 times the diameter of the rivet is the correct\namount for the rivet shank to protrude through the material to form the head. For heavy material,\nsuch as plates or ttings, from 2 to 2-1/2 times the rivet diameter may be used. The rivet should\nnot be excessively loose in the hole, as this condition will cause the rivet to bend over while\nbeing driven, and the shank will not be sufciently expanded to completely ll the hole. A drill\nfrom 0.002 inch to 0.004 inch larger than the rivet shank should be used for sheet and plate\nriveting. Parts should be held rmly together by clamps, screws, or bolts while they are being\ndrilled or riveted. The bucking bar is to be held against the end of the rivet shank. Exercise care\nwhile accomplishing this operation to prevent unseating the rivet by too much pressure. For the\nrst few blows, the bucking bar should be held lightly against the rivet shank so it will receive\nthe impact of the blow through the rivet. The bucking bar must be held square with the rivet\nto produce uniform upsets. As few blows as possible should be struck to properly upset rivet.\nBlows must be as uniform as possible.\nD.\nLoose Or Working Solid Shank Rivets.\n(1)\nRivets which appear to be loose shall be checked with a 0.002 inch feeler gauge by inserting the\ngauge around the head of the rivet in question. If the feeler gauge can be inserted to the shank\nof the rivet, it shall be classied as a loose rivet and it shall be replaced. If the feeler gauge can\nbe inserted approximately halfway to the shank for less than 30 percent of the circumference\nof the rivet head, it shall not be classied as a loose rivet. The feeler gauge shall be used to\ncheck the shear section between the riveted members (such as skin to spar or different sections\nof skins) in a similar manner to that used around the rivet head. If the skin around the brazier\nhead or countersunk rivet can be moved by depressing the skin with nger pressure around the\nrivet, the rivet shall be replaced. If a rivet is found which turns by applying a rotating load to the\nhead of the rivet, it should be replaced.\n(2)\nIn areas where exterior paint has been applied to rivet heads, the paint may harden due to aging\nprocesses and show hairline cracks around the edge of the rivet heads. This should not be\nused as a basis for determining whether or not the rivet is loose. The hardened paint may crack\nat times and collect dirt or exhaust fumes which will appear as discoloration. It is not possible\nto detect loose rivets visually. Replacement rivets should be of like size and type. In some\ninstances, however, it will be necessary to use the next size larger diameter. For general repair\npractices, the spacing between the centerlines of adjacent rivet holes shall be four diameters or\ngreater. In some areas where the spacing between rivets prohibits the use of the next larger\nrivets, special repair instructions and procedures shall be followed.\nContact Cessna Single\nEngine Support."

        "answer": "CAUTION: Incorrect use of solvent cleaners during panel replacement may lead to scratching on the wing root. Only use protective materials and ensure that ambient temperature is met before proceeding.\n\n10.\nThreaded Fasteners Bolt Torques\nA.\nThe importance of correct application cannot be overemphasized. Refer to appropriate Maintenance\nManual, Chapter 20, Torque Data - Maintenance Practices, for additional information covering torque\nvalues. Under torque can result in unnecessary wear of nuts and bolts as well as parts they are\nholding together. When insufcient pressures are applied, uneven loads will be transmitted throughout\nassembly, which may result in excessive wear or premature failure due to fatigue. Over torque can\nbe equally damaging because of failure of a bolt or nut from overstressing threaded areas. There are\na few simple, but very important, procedures that should be followed to assure that correct torque is\napplied:\n(1)\nCalibrate torque wrench periodically to assure accuracy, and recheck frequently.\n(2)\nBe sure that bolt and nut threads are clean and dry unless otherwise specied.\n(3)\nRun nut down to near contact with washer or bearing surface and check friction drag torque\nrequired to turn nut.\n(4)\nAdd friction drag torque to desired torque recommended. Refer to appropriate Maintenance\nManual, Chapter 20, Torque Data - Maintenance Practices to obtain complete torque calculating\nprocedures. This is referred to as nal torque which should register on indicator or setting for a\nsnap over-type wrench.\n(5)\nApply a smooth even pull when applying torque pressure. If chattering or a jerking motion occurs\nduring nal torque, back off and re-torque.\n(6)\nWhen installing a castellated nut, start alignment with cotter pin hole at minimum recommended\ntorque plus friction drag torque, and do not exceed maximum torque plus friction drag. If hole\nand nut castellation do not align, change washers or nut and try again. Exceeding maximum\nrecommended torque is not recommended unless specically allowed or recommended for that\nparticular installation."

        "answer": "WARNING: ventilate area. Failure to secure all panels before fastener removal may lead to fire hazard. Always inspect the wing root and verify that aircraft model.\n\n4.\nSubstitution Of Rivets\nA.\nWhen adapting the typical repairs shown in this manual to suit actual conditions, it may be necessary\nto use different fasteners than those originally used. This may be due to non-availability of a particular\nfastener, restricted access, or other difculties. When replacing rivets, it is desirable to use rivets\nidentical to the type of rivet removed. Countersunk head rivets are to be replaced by rivets of the\nsame type and degree of countersink. When rivet holes become enlarged, deformed, or otherwise\ndamaged, several options are available.\n(1)\nThe simplest solution is to install a 1/32 inch (0.032 inch) larger size rivet as a replacement. This\nsolution uses the designed repairability of the structure, and is the quickest repair.\n(2)\nRepair rivets are available.\n(a)\nRepair rivets have a shank that is 1/64 inch (0.016 inch) larger diameter than a standard\nrivet but have the same size and shape heads.\n(b)\nNAS1241 repair rivets replace MS20426 rivets if they have the same sufx.\n(c)\nNAS1242 repair rivets replace MS20470 rivets if they have the same sufx.\n(d)\nNAS1738, NAS1939 and some NAS9301 through NAS9311 blind rivets also have oversize\nshanks.\nB.\nReplacement shall not be made with rivets of lower strength material.\nC.\nHi-Shear Rivets.\n(1)\nWhen Hi-Shear rivets are not available, replacement of sizes 3/16 inch or greater rivets shall be\nmade with bolts of equal or greater strength than the rivet being replaced, and with self-locking\nnuts of the same diameter. It is permissible to replace Hi-Shear rivets with Hi-Lok bolts of the\nsame material, diameter and grip length.\nD.\nBlind Rivets.\n(1)\nBlind rivets have higher deection rates in shear than standard solid rivets, are more susceptible\nto fatigue failure and are not as strong as solid rivets in thin sheets. For this reason, it is not\nadvisable to replace any considerable number of solid rivets in a given joint by blind rivets,\nbecause this may result in overstressing the remaining solid rivets. The hollow blind rivet shall\nnot be used. The blind rivet shall be of the same or greater strength than the rivet it replaces. In\ncases of dimpled assemblies (the process of forming the metal around a hole to form a conical\nindentation to receive the tapered head of a ush rivet or a screw), the rivet holes shall be\ndrilled after the sheets are dimpled. When possible, the exposed end of each clipped plug\nshall be coated with epoxy primer. Blind rivets shall not be used in fuel bay areas except in\ncases of absolute necessity, and must be sealed. If blind fasteners other than blind rivets are\nencountered, it is recommended that replacements be made with identical fasteners.\nE.\nFor a list of approved solid shank and Hi-Shear rivet substitutions, refer to Tables 1 and 2."

        "answer": "WARNING: solvent cleaners must never be used near fuselage skin due to risk of toxic exposure. Before beginning the sealant application, ensure that the area is free of coolant vapor and personnel are wearing inspection mirror.\n\n2.\nRivets\nA.\nStandard solid shank MS rivets are those generally used in airplane construction.\nThey are\nfabricated in the following head types:\nroundhead, athead, countersunk head, and universal\nhead. Flathead rivets are generally used in the airplane interior, where head clearance is required.\nMS20426 countersunk head rivets are used on the exterior surfaces of the airplane to minimize\nturbulent airow. MS20470 universal head rivets are used on the exterior surfaces of the airplane\nwhere strength requirements necessitate a stronger rivet head than that of the countersunk head\nrivet. Hi-Shear rivets are special, patented rivets having a high shear strength equivalent to that of\nstandard NAS bolts. They are used in special cases in locations where high shear loads are present,\nsuch as in spars, wings, and in heavy bulkhead ribs. This rivet consists of a cadmium plated pin of\nalloy steel. Some have a collar of aluminum alloy. Some of these rivets can be readily identied by\nthe presence of the attached collar in place of the formed head on standard rivets. Blind rivets are\nused, where strength requirements permit, where one side of the structure is inaccessible, making it\nimpossible or impractical to drive standard solid shank rivets."

        "answer": "CAUTION: Before beginning any fastener removal, verify that the fuselage skin is isolated and secured. {Mistake} may result in unnecessary rework or component leakage.\n\n8.\nBlind Rivets\nA.\nGeneral.\n(1)\nBlind rivets are intended for use where access is available to only one side of the work.\n(2)\nReplacement of solid rivets with blind rivets should only be accomplished within the guidelines\nof Table 1, when the installation of a solid shank rivet is not possible. Blind rivets do not have the\nsame resistance to corrosion and fatigue as solid shank rivets, and should not be considered a\nuniversal replacement for solid shank rivets.\nB.\nRemoval of Blind Rivets.\nCAUTION: Do not drill completely through the rivet sleeve.

The rivet will pull down the\nsheet as the stem is pulled if the BK dimension is met or exceeded.\n(8)\nThe minimum blind clearance is the BK dimension, and is listed in the manufacturers standard\nsheets.\nNOTE:\nWhen installing a blind rivet (pull-type rivet) in a hole where the previous blind rivet\nwas removed by drilling and punching the rivet out, inspect the drilled hole to assure\nall metal sheets are in place and not separated prior to pulling rivet.\nIt may be\nnecessary to insert a stiff wire in adjacent hole to hold metal in position while pulling\nrivet.\n(9)\nWhen placing pulling head on rivet stem, hold riveter and pulling head in line with axis of rivet\nwhile holding tool in a light and exible manner.\n(10) When tool is actuated, pulling head will pull down and seat against rivet head.\n(11) Clamping action will pull sheets together and seat rivet when tool is actuated.\n(12) When tool is actuated, action of rivet will automatically assist in bringing tool and pulling head\ninto proper alignment with rivet axis.\nNOTE:\nPressing down with force will not allow rivet and tool to align themselves with hole\nand could limit head setting of rivet, however, enough force to seat the head against\nthe skin is necessary.\n(13) Hold tool in line with rivet as accurately as possible, and allow a steady but light pressure; pull\ntrigger and let the rivet align itself.\n(14) When rivet is completely installed, release trigger and pulling head will eject pulling portion of\nstem through forward end.\n(15) Rivet must break within these limits.\nFastener\nDash number\nStem Flushness\nNAS1738 or NAS1739\nAll\n+0.010 or -0.020 inch\nCherry Max\n-4\n+0.010 or -0.015 inch\nCherry Max\n-5, -6\n+0.010 or -0.020 inch\n(16) Protruding stems usually indicate incorrect grip length or oversize holes.\nD.\nLoose or Working Blind Rivets.\n(1)\nBlind rivets which are found to be loose or show evidence of working must be replaced with\nrivets of like size and type. In some instances, it may be necessary to use the next larger size\nrivet. Loose fasteners may be indicated by the following situation:\n(a)\nThe fastened material moves relative to the fastener. Skin deection is evident.\n(b)\nTipping of the fastener head may indicate its looseness or slippage. Rivet head periphery\nrolled upward also indicates looseness.\n(c)\nA black or dark gray stain is found adjacent to or around the fastener head. Generally, it\ntakes the form of a dirt or oily streak aft of the loose rivet.\n(d)\nMark a red line across the fastener head and the adjacent material. Check the line at the\nnext inspection. Any loosening of the fastener will break the line as indicated in Figure 3."

        "question": "What are the specific rules and guidelines for using feeler gauges to check for loose rivets, and how should the gauge be inserted around the head of the rivet to determine if it needs to be replaced?",
        "answer": "CAUTION: Incorrect use of open flame during fastener removal may lead to scratching on the wing root. Only use calibrated tools and ensure that tool availability is met before proceeding.\n\n7.\nSolid Shank Rivets\nA.\nRemoval of Solid Shank Rivets (Refer to Figure 1).\n(1)\nWhen it becomes necessary to replace a rivet, extreme care should be taken in its removal so\nthat the rivet hole will retain its original size and replacement with a larger size rivet will not be\nnecessary. If the rivet is not removed properly, the strength of the joint may be weakened and\nthe replacement of rivets made more difcult.\n(2)\nWhen removing a rivet, work on the manufactured head. It is more symmetrical about the shank\nthan the shop head, and there will be less chance of damaging the rivet hole or the material\naround it. To remove rivets, use hand tools, a power drill or a combination of both. The preferred\nmethod is to drill through the rivet head and drive out the remainder of the rivet with a drift punch.\nFirst, le a at area on the head of any round or brazier head rivet, and center punch the at\nsurface for drilling. On thin metal, back up the rivet on the shop head when center punching\nto avoid depressing the metal. The dimple in 2117-T3 rivets usually eliminates the necessity of\nling and center punching the rivet.\n(3)\nSelect a drill one size smaller than the rivet shank and drill out the rivet head. When using a\npower drill, set the drill on the rivet and rotate the chuck several revolutions by hand before\nturning on the power. This procedure helps the drill cut a good starting spot and eliminates the\nchance of the drill slipping off and tracking across the metal. While holding the drill at a 90Â°\nangle, drill the rivet to the depth of its head. Be careful not to drill too deep because the rivet\nshank will turn with the drill and cause a tear. The rivet head will often break away and climb the\ndrill, which is a good signal to withdraw the drill. If the rivet head does not come lose of its own\naccord, insert a drift punch into the hole and twist slightly to either side until the head comes off.\n(4)\nDrive out the shank of the rivet with a drift punch slightly smaller than the diameter of the shank.\nOn thin metal or unsupported structures, support the sheet with a bucking bar while driving out\nthe shank. If the shank is exceptionally tight after the rivet head is removed, drill the rivet about\ntwo-thirds of the way through the thickness of the material and then drive out the remainder of\nthe rivet with a drift punch.\n(5)\nThe removal of ush rivets is the same as that just described except that no ling of the\nmanufactured head is required before center punching. Be very careful to avoid elongation\nof the dimpled or the countersunk holes. The rivet head should be drilled to approximately\none-half the thickness of the top sheet.\nTable 1.

NAS1738M4-4\nrivets may be identied as AIA/NAS1738M4-4.\nC.\nInstallation of Solid Shank Rivets.\n(1)\nA large percentage of riveting of airplane structure is accomplished on thin gauge aluminum alloy,\nand the work must be accomplished without distorting or damaging the material with hammer\nblows or riveting tools. All airplane power riveting is accomplished by upsetting the rivets against\na bucking bar instead of striking the shank with a hammer. To prevent deforming the rivet head,\na rivet set must be selected to t each type of rivet. The depth of this set must not touch material\nbeing riveted. Parts requiring heat treatment should be heat treated before riveting, since heat\ntreating process after rivet installation causes warping. Assemblies that require heat treatment\nin a salt bath must be treated prior to assembly, as the salt cannot be entirely washed out of the\njoints.\n(2)\nThe use of hollow rivets in joining highly stressed parts is not permitted. To determine if blind\nrivets may be substituted, refer to Tables 1 and 2. Selection of the proper rivet and the proper\nnumber of rivets is very important. Rivets must be of the proper length for the total thickness of\nthe parts being riveted. Ordinarily, from 1-1/2 to 2 times the diameter of the rivet is the correct\namount for the rivet shank to protrude through the material to form the head. For heavy material,\nsuch as plates or ttings, from 2 to 2-1/2 times the rivet diameter may be used. The rivet should\nnot be excessively loose in the hole, as this condition will cause the rivet to bend over while\nbeing driven, and the shank will not be sufciently expanded to completely ll the hole. A drill\nfrom 0.002 inch to 0.004 inch larger than the rivet shank should be used for sheet and plate\nriveting. Parts should be held rmly together by clamps, screws, or bolts while they are being\ndrilled or riveted. The bucking bar is to be held against the end of the rivet shank. Exercise care\nwhile accomplishing this operation to prevent unseating the rivet by too much pressure. For the\nrst few blows, the bucking bar should be held lightly against the rivet shank so it will receive\nthe impact of the blow through the rivet. The bucking bar must be held square with the rivet\nto produce uniform upsets. As few blows as possible should be struck to properly upset rivet.\nBlows must be as uniform as possible.\nD.\nLoose Or Working Solid Shank Rivets.\n(1)\nRivets which appear to be loose shall be checked with a 0.002 inch feeler gauge by inserting the\ngauge around the head of the rivet in question. If the feeler gauge can be inserted to the shank\nof the rivet, it shall be classied as a loose rivet and it shall be replaced. If the feeler gauge can\nbe inserted approximately halfway to the shank for less than 30 percent of the circumference\nof the rivet head, it shall not be classied as a loose rivet. The feeler gauge shall be used to\ncheck the shear section between the riveted members (such as skin to spar or different sections\nof skins) in a similar manner to that used around the rivet head. If the skin around the brazier\nhead or countersunk rivet can be moved by depressing the skin with nger pressure around the\nrivet, the rivet shall be replaced. If a rivet is found which turns by applying a rotating load to the\nhead of the rivet, it should be replaced.\n(2)\nIn areas where exterior paint has been applied to rivet heads, the paint may harden due to aging\nprocesses and show hairline cracks around the edge of the rivet heads. This should not be\nused as a basis for determining whether or not the rivet is loose. The hardened paint may crack\nat times and collect dirt or exhaust fumes which will appear as discoloration. It is not possible\nto detect loose rivets visually. Replacement rivets should be of like size and type. In some\ninstances, however, it will be necessary to use the next size larger diameter. For general repair\npractices, the spacing between the centerlines of adjacent rivet holes shall be four diameters or\ngreater. In some areas where the spacing between rivets prohibits the use of the next larger\nrivets, special repair instructions and procedures shall be followed.\nContact Cessna Single\nEngine Support."

        "answer": "WARNING: solvent cleaners must never be used near fuselage skin due to risk of toxic exposure. Before beginning the sealant application, ensure that the area is free of coolant vapor and personnel are wearing inspection mirror.\n\n2.\nRivets\nA.\nStandard solid shank MS rivets are those generally used in airplane construction.\nThey are\nfabricated in the following head types:\nroundhead, athead, countersunk head, and universal\nhead. Flathead rivets are generally used in the airplane interior, where head clearance is required.\nMS20426 countersunk head rivets are used on the exterior surfaces of the airplane to minimize\nturbulent airow. MS20470 universal head rivets are used on the exterior surfaces of the airplane\nwhere strength requirements necessitate a stronger rivet head than that of the countersunk head\nrivet. Hi-Shear rivets are special, patented rivets having a high shear strength equivalent to that of\nstandard NAS bolts. They are used in special cases in locations where high shear loads are present,\nsuch as in spars, wings, and in heavy bulkhead ribs. This rivet consists of a cadmium plated pin of\nalloy steel. Some have a collar of aluminum alloy. Some of these rivets can be readily identied by\nthe presence of the attached collar in place of the formed head on standard rivets. Blind rivets are\nused, where strength requirements permit, where one side of the structure is inaccessible, making it\nimpossible or impractical to drive standard solid shank rivets."

Should too long a rivet be used, the formed\nhead will be too large, or the rivet may bend or be forced between the sheets being riveted. Should\ntoo short a rivet be used, the formed head will be too small or the riveted material will be damaged.\nIf proper length rivets are not available, longer rivets may be cut off to equal the proper length (not\ngrip).

        "question": "What is the significance of using a consistent rivet pitch in repairs, and how does it relate to maintaining the original structural integrity of the aircraft?",
        "answer": "NOTE: If the engine nacelle shows any signs of cracks, do not proceed with the panel replacement until proper inspection and corrective action have been taken.\n\n9.\nSpacing Of Rivets\nA.\nThere are no specic rules which are applicable to every case or type of riveting. There are, however,\ncertain general rules which should be understood and followed. Edge distance of rivets should not\nbe less than two diameters of the rivet, measured from the edge of the sheet or plate to the center of\nthe rivet hole. Spacing between rivets, when in rows, depends upon several factors, principally the\nthickness of the sheet, the diameter of the rivets, and the manner in which the sheet will be stressed.\nThis spacing is seldom less than four diameters of the rivet, measured between the centers of the rivet\nholes. Rivets, spaced four diameters apart, are found in certain seams of semimonocoque fuselages,\nwebs or built up spars, and various plates or ttings. Where there are two rows of rivets, they are\nusually staggered. The transverse pitch or distance between rows should be slightly less than the\npitch of the rivets, with 75 percent of the rivet pitch being the usual practice. An average spacing or\npitch of rivets in the cover or skin of most structures, except at highly stressed points, will be from 6\nto 12 diameters of the rivet. The best practice in repair is to make pitch of rivets equal to those in the\noriginal structure."

        "answer": "WARNING: ventilate area. Failure to secure all panels before fastener removal may lead to fire hazard. Always inspect the wing root and verify that aircraft model.\n\n4.\nSubstitution Of Rivets\nA.\nWhen adapting the typical repairs shown in this manual to suit actual conditions, it may be necessary\nto use different fasteners than those originally used. This may be due to non-availability of a particular\nfastener, restricted access, or other difculties. When replacing rivets, it is desirable to use rivets\nidentical to the type of rivet removed. Countersunk head rivets are to be replaced by rivets of the\nsame type and degree of countersink. When rivet holes become enlarged, deformed, or otherwise\ndamaged, several options are available.\n(1)\nThe simplest solution is to install a 1/32 inch (0.032 inch) larger size rivet as a replacement. This\nsolution uses the designed repairability of the structure, and is the quickest repair.\n(2)\nRepair rivets are available.\n(a)\nRepair rivets have a shank that is 1/64 inch (0.016 inch) larger diameter than a standard\nrivet but have the same size and shape heads.\n(b)\nNAS1241 repair rivets replace MS20426 rivets if they have the same sufx.\n(c)\nNAS1242 repair rivets replace MS20470 rivets if they have the same sufx.\n(d)\nNAS1738, NAS1939 and some NAS9301 through NAS9311 blind rivets also have oversize\nshanks.\nB.\nReplacement shall not be made with rivets of lower strength material.\nC.\nHi-Shear Rivets.\n(1)\nWhen Hi-Shear rivets are not available, replacement of sizes 3/16 inch or greater rivets shall be\nmade with bolts of equal or greater strength than the rivet being replaced, and with self-locking\nnuts of the same diameter. It is permissible to replace Hi-Shear rivets with Hi-Lok bolts of the\nsame material, diameter and grip length.\nD.\nBlind Rivets.\n(1)\nBlind rivets have higher deection rates in shear than standard solid rivets, are more susceptible\nto fatigue failure and are not as strong as solid rivets in thin sheets. For this reason, it is not\nadvisable to replace any considerable number of solid rivets in a given joint by blind rivets,\nbecause this may result in overstressing the remaining solid rivets. The hollow blind rivet shall\nnot be used. The blind rivet shall be of the same or greater strength than the rivet it replaces. In\ncases of dimpled assemblies (the process of forming the metal around a hole to form a conical\nindentation to receive the tapered head of a ush rivet or a screw), the rivet holes shall be\ndrilled after the sheets are dimpled. When possible, the exposed end of each clipped plug\nshall be coated with epoxy primer. Blind rivets shall not be used in fuel bay areas except in\ncases of absolute necessity, and must be sealed. If blind fasteners other than blind rivets are\nencountered, it is recommended that replacements be made with identical fasteners.\nE.\nFor a list of approved solid shank and Hi-Shear rivet substitutions, refer to Tables 1 and 2."

        "answer": "NOTE: This procedure applies specifically to aircraft models with engine nacelle configurations post-2015. For older models, refer to AMM revision 22B or later. Always verify tool availability before beginning.\n\n11.\nRivets for Plastic or Composite Parts\nA.\nUnlike rivets in metallic joints, blind rivets are often the rivet of choice for riveting non-metallic materials\nbecause they may be installed without the hammering necessary to install solid rivets. If the tail end\nof the rivet is adjacent to the non-metal side, install a washer over the shank to prevent the \"hole\nlling\" action built into blind rivets from overloading the non-metal hole. The hole in the washer should\nmatch the specied installation hole for the fastener. If the tail end of the rivet is installed through\nmetal substructure, the washer is not necessary.\nB.\nSoft (\"A\" 1100 aluminum shank rivets or \"B\" 5056 aluminum shank) rivets are also used to install non-\nmetallic parts. Original equipment soft rivets will be either red or green colored under the paint. If the\nbutt or driven end of the rivet is adjacent to the non-metallic part, it is preferable to install a washer over\nthe shank to prevent the rivet shank, which swells during driving, from overloading the non-metallic\nhole. The hole in the washer should match the specied installation hole for the fastener. If the tail\nend of the rivet is installed through metal substructure, the washer is not necessary. Take care when\ndriving rivets through non-metal to not overdrive the rivet. If the rivet is overdriven, the shank will swell\neven with the washer in place. The rivet butt should be driven to no more than necessary to retain\nthe part, never more than 1.4 times the shank diameter.\nC.\nIf the original equipment rivet provided connection between metal parts as well as non-metallic parts,\nit may be a standard (AD) rivet. Original equipment AD rivets are colored gold or uncolored. Replace\noriginal equipment AD rivets with AD rivets.\n"

        "question": "What are the specific considerations for preventing the rivet from bending over while being driven, and how can the rivet shank be sufficiently expanded to completely fill the hole during the riveting process?",
        "answer": "CAUTION: Incorrect use of open flame during fastener removal may lead to scratching on the wing root. Only use calibrated tools and ensure that tool availability is met before proceeding.\n\n7.\nSolid Shank Rivets\nA.\nRemoval of Solid Shank Rivets (Refer to Figure 1).\n(1)\nWhen it becomes necessary to replace a rivet, extreme care should be taken in its removal so\nthat the rivet hole will retain its original size and replacement with a larger size rivet will not be\nnecessary. If the rivet is not removed properly, the strength of the joint may be weakened and\nthe replacement of rivets made more difcult.\n(2)\nWhen removing a rivet, work on the manufactured head. It is more symmetrical about the shank\nthan the shop head, and there will be less chance of damaging the rivet hole or the material\naround it. To remove rivets, use hand tools, a power drill or a combination of both. The preferred\nmethod is to drill through the rivet head and drive out the remainder of the rivet with a drift punch.\nFirst, le a at area on the head of any round or brazier head rivet, and center punch the at\nsurface for drilling. On thin metal, back up the rivet on the shop head when center punching\nto avoid depressing the metal. The dimple in 2117-T3 rivets usually eliminates the necessity of\nling and center punching the rivet.\n(3)\nSelect a drill one size smaller than the rivet shank and drill out the rivet head. When using a\npower drill, set the drill on the rivet and rotate the chuck several revolutions by hand before\nturning on the power. This procedure helps the drill cut a good starting spot and eliminates the\nchance of the drill slipping off and tracking across the metal. While holding the drill at a 90Â°\nangle, drill the rivet to the depth of its head. Be careful not to drill too deep because the rivet\nshank will turn with the drill and cause a tear. The rivet head will often break away and climb the\ndrill, which is a good signal to withdraw the drill. If the rivet head does not come lose of its own\naccord, insert a drift punch into the hole and twist slightly to either side until the head comes off.\n(4)\nDrive out the shank of the rivet with a drift punch slightly smaller than the diameter of the shank.\nOn thin metal or unsupported structures, support the sheet with a bucking bar while driving out\nthe shank. If the shank is exceptionally tight after the rivet head is removed, drill the rivet about\ntwo-thirds of the way through the thickness of the material and then drive out the remainder of\nthe rivet with a drift punch.\n(5)\nThe removal of ush rivets is the same as that just described except that no ling of the\nmanufactured head is required before center punching. Be very careful to avoid elongation\nof the dimpled or the countersunk holes. The rivet head should be drilled to approximately\none-half the thickness of the top sheet.\nTable 1.

NAS1738M4-4\nrivets may be identied as AIA/NAS1738M4-4.\nC.\nInstallation of Solid Shank Rivets.\n(1)\nA large percentage of riveting of airplane structure is accomplished on thin gauge aluminum alloy,\nand the work must be accomplished without distorting or damaging the material with hammer\nblows or riveting tools. All airplane power riveting is accomplished by upsetting the rivets against\na bucking bar instead of striking the shank with a hammer. To prevent deforming the rivet head,\na rivet set must be selected to t each type of rivet. The depth of this set must not touch material\nbeing riveted. Parts requiring heat treatment should be heat treated before riveting, since heat\ntreating process after rivet installation causes warping. Assemblies that require heat treatment\nin a salt bath must be treated prior to assembly, as the salt cannot be entirely washed out of the\njoints.\n(2)\nThe use of hollow rivets in joining highly stressed parts is not permitted. To determine if blind\nrivets may be substituted, refer to Tables 1 and 2. Selection of the proper rivet and the proper\nnumber of rivets is very important. Rivets must be of the proper length for the total thickness of\nthe parts being riveted. Ordinarily, from 1-1/2 to 2 times the diameter of the rivet is the correct\namount for the rivet shank to protrude through the material to form the head. For heavy material,\nsuch as plates or ttings, from 2 to 2-1/2 times the rivet diameter may be used. The rivet should\nnot be excessively loose in the hole, as this condition will cause the rivet to bend over while\nbeing driven, and the shank will not be sufciently expanded to completely ll the hole. A drill\nfrom 0.002 inch to 0.004 inch larger than the rivet shank should be used for sheet and plate\nriveting. Parts should be held rmly together by clamps, screws, or bolts while they are being\ndrilled or riveted. The bucking bar is to be held against the end of the rivet shank. Exercise care\nwhile accomplishing this operation to prevent unseating the rivet by too much pressure. For the\nrst few blows, the bucking bar should be held lightly against the rivet shank so it will receive\nthe impact of the blow through the rivet. The bucking bar must be held square with the rivet\nto produce uniform upsets. As few blows as possible should be struck to properly upset rivet.\nBlows must be as uniform as possible.\nD.\nLoose Or Working Solid Shank Rivets.\n(1)\nRivets which appear to be loose shall be checked with a 0.002 inch feeler gauge by inserting the\ngauge around the head of the rivet in question. If the feeler gauge can be inserted to the shank\nof the rivet, it shall be classied as a loose rivet and it shall be replaced. If the feeler gauge can\nbe inserted approximately halfway to the shank for less than 30 percent of the circumference\nof the rivet head, it shall not be classied as a loose rivet. The feeler gauge shall be used to\ncheck the shear section between the riveted members (such as skin to spar or different sections\nof skins) in a similar manner to that used around the rivet head.

If a rivet is found which turns by applying a rotating load to the\nhead of the rivet, it should be replaced.\n(2)\nIn areas where exterior paint has been applied to rivet heads, the paint may harden due to aging\nprocesses and show hairline cracks around the edge of the rivet heads. This should not be\nused as a basis for determining whether or not the rivet is loose. The hardened paint may crack\nat times and collect dirt or exhaust fumes which will appear as discoloration.

        "answer": "WARNING: Inadequate panel replacement of the engine nacelle may compromise aircraft integrity. Always wear insulated gloves, follow approved methods, and check for discoloration before returning to service.\n\n1.\nGeneral\nA.\nFasteners used in the airplane are generally solid aluminum rivets, blind rivets, and steel threaded\nfasteners. Usage of each is primarily a function of the loads to be carried, accessibility and frequency\nof removal. Rivets used in airplane construction are usually fabricated from aluminum alloys. In\nspecial cases, monel, corrosion-resistant steel and mild steel, copper, and iron rivets are used."

        "answer": "NOTE: This procedure applies specifically to aircraft models with engine nacelle configurations post-2015. For older models, refer to AMM revision 22B or later. Always verify tool availability before beginning.\n\n11.\nRivets for Plastic or Composite Parts\nA.\nUnlike rivets in metallic joints, blind rivets are often the rivet of choice for riveting non-metallic materials\nbecause they may be installed without the hammering necessary to install solid rivets. If the tail end\nof the rivet is adjacent to the non-metal side, install a washer over the shank to prevent the \"hole\nlling\" action built into blind rivets from overloading the non-metal hole. The hole in the washer should\nmatch the specied installation hole for the fastener. If the tail end of the rivet is installed through\nmetal substructure, the washer is not necessary.\nB.\nSoft (\"A\" 1100 aluminum shank rivets or \"B\" 5056 aluminum shank) rivets are also used to install non-\nmetallic parts. Original equipment soft rivets will be either red or green colored under the paint. If the\nbutt or driven end of the rivet is adjacent to the non-metallic part, it is preferable to install a washer over\nthe shank to prevent the rivet shank, which swells during driving, from overloading the non-metallic\nhole. The hole in the washer should match the specied installation hole for the fastener. If the tail\nend of the rivet is installed through metal substructure, the washer is not necessary. Take care when\ndriving rivets through non-metal to not overdrive the rivet. If the rivet is overdriven, the shank will swell\neven with the washer in place. The rivet butt should be driven to no more than necessary to retain\nthe part, never more than 1.4 times the shank diameter.\nC.\nIf the original equipment rivet provided connection between metal parts as well as non-metallic parts,\nit may be a standard (AD) rivet. Original equipment AD rivets are colored gold or uncolored. Replace\noriginal equipment AD rivets with AD rivets.\n"

        "question": "What are the specific considerations and guidelines for substituting threaded fasteners for high-strength steel shank rivets, and what types of steel nuts are approved for use in these applications?",
        "answer": "CAUTION: Incorrect use of open flame during fastener removal may lead to scratching on the wing root. Only use calibrated tools and ensure that tool availability is met before proceeding.\n\n7.\nSolid Shank Rivets\nA.\nRemoval of Solid Shank Rivets (Refer to Figure 1).\n(1)\nWhen it becomes necessary to replace a rivet, extreme care should be taken in its removal so\nthat the rivet hole will retain its original size and replacement with a larger size rivet will not be\nnecessary. If the rivet is not removed properly, the strength of the joint may be weakened and\nthe replacement of rivets made more difcult.\n(2)\nWhen removing a rivet, work on the manufactured head. It is more symmetrical about the shank\nthan the shop head, and there will be less chance of damaging the rivet hole or the material\naround it. To remove rivets, use hand tools, a power drill or a combination of both. The preferred\nmethod is to drill through the rivet head and drive out the remainder of the rivet with a drift punch.\nFirst, le a at area on the head of any round or brazier head rivet, and center punch the at\nsurface for drilling. On thin metal, back up the rivet on the shop head when center punching\nto avoid depressing the metal. The dimple in 2117-T3 rivets usually eliminates the necessity of\nling and center punching the rivet.\n(3)\nSelect a drill one size smaller than the rivet shank and drill out the rivet head. When using a\npower drill, set the drill on the rivet and rotate the chuck several revolutions by hand before\nturning on the power. This procedure helps the drill cut a good starting spot and eliminates the\nchance of the drill slipping off and tracking across the metal. While holding the drill at a 90Â°\nangle, drill the rivet to the depth of its head. Be careful not to drill too deep because the rivet\nshank will turn with the drill and cause a tear. The rivet head will often break away and climb the\ndrill, which is a good signal to withdraw the drill. If the rivet head does not come lose of its own\naccord, insert a drift punch into the hole and twist slightly to either side until the head comes off.\n(4)\nDrive out the shank of the rivet with a drift punch slightly smaller than the diameter of the shank.\nOn thin metal or unsupported structures, support the sheet with a bucking bar while driving out\nthe shank. If the shank is exceptionally tight after the rivet head is removed, drill the rivet about\ntwo-thirds of the way through the thickness of the material and then drive out the remainder of\nthe rivet with a drift punch.\n(5)\nThe removal of ush rivets is the same as that just described except that no ling of the\nmanufactured head is required before center punching. Be very careful to avoid elongation\nof the dimpled or the countersunk holes. The rivet head should be drilled to approximately\none-half the thickness of the top sheet.\nTable 1.

NAS1738M4-4\nrivets may be identied as AIA/NAS1738M4-4.\nC.\nInstallation of Solid Shank Rivets.\n(1)\nA large percentage of riveting of airplane structure is accomplished on thin gauge aluminum alloy,\nand the work must be accomplished without distorting or damaging the material with hammer\nblows or riveting tools. All airplane power riveting is accomplished by upsetting the rivets against\na bucking bar instead of striking the shank with a hammer. To prevent deforming the rivet head,\na rivet set must be selected to t each type of rivet. The depth of this set must not touch material\nbeing riveted. Parts requiring heat treatment should be heat treated before riveting, since heat\ntreating process after rivet installation causes warping. Assemblies that require heat treatment\nin a salt bath must be treated prior to assembly, as the salt cannot be entirely washed out of the\njoints.\n(2)\nThe use of hollow rivets in joining highly stressed parts is not permitted. To determine if blind\nrivets may be substituted, refer to Tables 1 and 2. Selection of the proper rivet and the proper\nnumber of rivets is very important. Rivets must be of the proper length for the total thickness of\nthe parts being riveted. Ordinarily, from 1-1/2 to 2 times the diameter of the rivet is the correct\namount for the rivet shank to protrude through the material to form the head. For heavy material,\nsuch as plates or ttings, from 2 to 2-1/2 times the rivet diameter may be used. The rivet should\nnot be excessively loose in the hole, as this condition will cause the rivet to bend over while\nbeing driven, and the shank will not be sufciently expanded to completely ll the hole. A drill\nfrom 0.002 inch to 0.004 inch larger than the rivet shank should be used for sheet and plate\nriveting. Parts should be held rmly together by clamps, screws, or bolts while they are being\ndrilled or riveted. The bucking bar is to be held against the end of the rivet shank. Exercise care\nwhile accomplishing this operation to prevent unseating the rivet by too much pressure. For the\nrst few blows, the bucking bar should be held lightly against the rivet shank so it will receive\nthe impact of the blow through the rivet. The bucking bar must be held square with the rivet\nto produce uniform upsets. As few blows as possible should be struck to properly upset rivet.\nBlows must be as uniform as possible.\nD.\nLoose Or Working Solid Shank Rivets.\n(1)\nRivets which appear to be loose shall be checked with a 0.002 inch feeler gauge by inserting the\ngauge around the head of the rivet in question. If the feeler gauge can be inserted to the shank\nof the rivet, it shall be classied as a loose rivet and it shall be replaced. If the feeler gauge can\nbe inserted approximately halfway to the shank for less than 30 percent of the circumference\nof the rivet head, it shall not be classied as a loose rivet. The feeler gauge shall be used to\ncheck the shear section between the riveted members (such as skin to spar or different sections\nof skins) in a similar manner to that used around the rivet head. If the skin around the brazier\nhead or countersunk rivet can be moved by depressing the skin with nger pressure around the\nrivet, the rivet shall be replaced. If a rivet is found which turns by applying a rotating load to the\nhead of the rivet, it should be replaced.\n(2)\nIn areas where exterior paint has been applied to rivet heads, the paint may harden due to aging\nprocesses and show hairline cracks around the edge of the rivet heads. This should not be\nused as a basis for determining whether or not the rivet is loose. The hardened paint may crack\nat times and collect dirt or exhaust fumes which will appear as discoloration. It is not possible\nto detect loose rivets visually. Replacement rivets should be of like size and type. In some\ninstances, however, it will be necessary to use the next size larger diameter. For general repair\npractices, the spacing between the centerlines of adjacent rivet holes shall be four diameters or\ngreater. In some areas where the spacing between rivets prohibits the use of the next larger\nrivets, special repair instructions and procedures shall be followed.\nContact Cessna Single\nEngine Support."

        "answer": "NOTE: This procedure applies specifically to aircraft models with engine nacelle configurations post-2015. For older models, refer to AMM revision 22B or later. Always verify tool availability before beginning.\n\n11.\nRivets for Plastic or Composite Parts\nA.\nUnlike rivets in metallic joints, blind rivets are often the rivet of choice for riveting non-metallic materials\nbecause they may be installed without the hammering necessary to install solid rivets. If the tail end\nof the rivet is adjacent to the non-metal side, install a washer over the shank to prevent the \"hole\nlling\" action built into blind rivets from overloading the non-metal hole. The hole in the washer should\nmatch the specied installation hole for the fastener. If the tail end of the rivet is installed through\nmetal substructure, the washer is not necessary.\nB.\nSoft (\"A\" 1100 aluminum shank rivets or \"B\" 5056 aluminum shank) rivets are also used to install non-\nmetallic parts. Original equipment soft rivets will be either red or green colored under the paint. If the\nbutt or driven end of the rivet is adjacent to the non-metallic part, it is preferable to install a washer over\nthe shank to prevent the rivet shank, which swells during driving, from overloading the non-metallic\nhole. The hole in the washer should match the specied installation hole for the fastener. If the tail\nend of the rivet is installed through metal substructure, the washer is not necessary. Take care when\ndriving rivets through non-metal to not overdrive the rivet. If the rivet is overdriven, the shank will swell\neven with the washer in place. The rivet butt should be driven to no more than necessary to retain\nthe part, never more than 1.4 times the shank diameter.\nC.\nIf the original equipment rivet provided connection between metal parts as well as non-metallic parts,\nit may be a standard (AD) rivet. Original equipment AD rivets are colored gold or uncolored. Replace\noriginal equipment AD rivets with AD rivets.\n"

        "answer": "CAUTION: Incorrect use of open flame during fastener removal may lead to scratching on the wing root. Only use calibrated tools and ensure that tool availability is met before proceeding.\n\n7.\nSolid Shank Rivets\nA.\nRemoval of Solid Shank Rivets (Refer to Figure 1).\n(1)\nWhen it becomes necessary to replace a rivet, extreme care should be taken in its removal so\nthat the rivet hole will retain its original size and replacement with a larger size rivet will not be\nnecessary. If the rivet is not removed properly, the strength of the joint may be weakened and\nthe replacement of rivets made more difcult.\n(2)\nWhen removing a rivet, work on the manufactured head. It is more symmetrical about the shank\nthan the shop head, and there will be less chance of damaging the rivet hole or the material\naround it. To remove rivets, use hand tools, a power drill or a combination of both. The preferred\nmethod is to drill through the rivet head and drive out the remainder of the rivet with a drift punch.\nFirst, le a at area on the head of any round or brazier head rivet, and center punch the at\nsurface for drilling. On thin metal, back up the rivet on the shop head when center punching\nto avoid depressing the metal. The dimple in 2117-T3 rivets usually eliminates the necessity of\nling and center punching the rivet.\n(3)\nSelect a drill one size smaller than the rivet shank and drill out the rivet head. When using a\npower drill, set the drill on the rivet and rotate the chuck several revolutions by hand before\nturning on the power. This procedure helps the drill cut a good starting spot and eliminates the\nchance of the drill slipping off and tracking across the metal. While holding the drill at a 90Â°\nangle, drill the rivet to the depth of its head. Be careful not to drill too deep because the rivet\nshank will turn with the drill and cause a tear. The rivet head will often break away and climb the\ndrill, which is a good signal to withdraw the drill. If the rivet head does not come lose of its own\naccord, insert a drift punch into the hole and twist slightly to either side until the head comes off.\n(4)\nDrive out the shank of the rivet with a drift punch slightly smaller than the diameter of the shank.\nOn thin metal or unsupported structures, support the sheet with a bucking bar while driving out\nthe shank. If the shank is exceptionally tight after the rivet head is removed, drill the rivet about\ntwo-thirds of the way through the thickness of the material and then drive out the remainder of\nthe rivet with a drift punch.\n(5)\nThe removal of ush rivets is the same as that just described except that no ling of the\nmanufactured head is required before center punching.

NAS1738M4-4\nrivets may be identied as AIA/NAS1738M4-4.\nC.\nInstallation of Solid Shank Rivets.\n(1)\nA large percentage of riveting of airplane structure is accomplished on thin gauge aluminum alloy,\nand the work must be accomplished without distorting or damaging the material with hammer\nblows or riveting tools. All airplane power riveting is accomplished by upsetting the rivets against\na bucking bar instead of striking the shank with a hammer. To prevent deforming the rivet head,\na rivet set must be selected to t each type of rivet. The depth of this set must not touch material\nbeing riveted. Parts requiring heat treatment should be heat treated before riveting, since heat\ntreating process after rivet installation causes warping. Assemblies that require heat treatment\nin a salt bath must be treated prior to assembly, as the salt cannot be entirely washed out of the\njoints.\n(2)\nThe use of hollow rivets in joining highly stressed parts is not permitted. To determine if blind\nrivets may be substituted, refer to Tables 1 and 2. Selection of the proper rivet and the proper\nnumber of rivets is very important. Rivets must be of the proper length for the total thickness of\nthe parts being riveted. Ordinarily, from 1-1/2 to 2 times the diameter of the rivet is the correct\namount for the rivet shank to protrude through the material to form the head. For heavy material,\nsuch as plates or ttings, from 2 to 2-1/2 times the rivet diameter may be used. The rivet should\nnot be excessively loose in the hole, as this condition will cause the rivet to bend over while\nbeing driven, and the shank will not be sufciently expanded to completely ll the hole. A drill\nfrom 0.002 inch to 0.004 inch larger than the rivet shank should be used for sheet and plate\nriveting. Parts should be held rmly together by clamps, screws, or bolts while they are being\ndrilled or riveted. The bucking bar is to be held against the end of the rivet shank. Exercise care\nwhile accomplishing this operation to prevent unseating the rivet by too much pressure. For the\nrst few blows, the bucking bar should be held lightly against the rivet shank so it will receive\nthe impact of the blow through the rivet. The bucking bar must be held square with the rivet\nto produce uniform upsets. As few blows as possible should be struck to properly upset rivet.\nBlows must be as uniform as possible.\nD.\nLoose Or Working Solid Shank Rivets.\n(1)\nRivets which appear to be loose shall be checked with a 0.002 inch feeler gauge by inserting the\ngauge around the head of the rivet in question. If the feeler gauge can be inserted to the shank\nof the rivet, it shall be classied as a loose rivet and it shall be replaced. If the feeler gauge can\nbe inserted approximately halfway to the shank for less than 30 percent of the circumference\nof the rivet head, it shall not be classied as a loose rivet. The feeler gauge shall be used to\ncheck the shear section between the riveted members (such as skin to spar or different sections\nof skins) in a similar manner to that used around the rivet head. If the skin around the brazier\nhead or countersunk rivet can be moved by depressing the skin with nger pressure around the\nrivet, the rivet shall be replaced. If a rivet is found which turns by applying a rotating load to the\nhead of the rivet, it should be replaced.\n(2)\nIn areas where exterior paint has been applied to rivet heads, the paint may harden due to aging\nprocesses and show hairline cracks around the edge of the rivet heads. This should not be\nused as a basis for determining whether or not the rivet is loose. The hardened paint may crack\nat times and collect dirt or exhaust fumes which will appear as discoloration. It is not possible\nto detect loose rivets visually. Replacement rivets should be of like size and type. In some\ninstances, however, it will be necessary to use the next size larger diameter. For general repair\npractices, the spacing between the centerlines of adjacent rivet holes shall be four diameters or\ngreater. In some areas where the spacing between rivets prohibits the use of the next larger\nrivets, special repair instructions and procedures shall be followed.\nContact Cessna Single\nEngine Support."

Before beginning the sealant application, ensure that the area is free of coolant vapor and personnel are wearing inspection mirror.\n\n2.\nRivets\nA.\nStandard solid shank MS rivets are those generally used in airplane construction.\nThey are\nfabricated in the following head types:\nroundhead, athead, countersunk head, and universal\nhead. Flathead rivets are generally used in the airplane interior, where head clearance is required.\nMS20426 countersunk head rivets are used on the exterior surfaces of the airplane to minimize\nturbulent airow. MS20470 universal head rivets are used on the exterior surfaces of the airplane\nwhere strength requirements necessitate a stronger rivet head than that of the countersunk head\nrivet. Hi-Shear rivets are special, patented rivets having a high shear strength equivalent to that of\nstandard NAS bolts. They are used in special cases in locations where high shear loads are present,\nsuch as in spars, wings, and in heavy bulkhead ribs. This rivet consists of a cadmium plated pin of\nalloy steel. Some have a collar of aluminum alloy. Some of these rivets can be readily identied by\nthe presence of the attached collar in place of the formed head on standard rivets. Blind rivets are\nused, where strength requirements permit, where one side of the structure is inaccessible, making it\nimpossible or impractical to drive standard solid shank rivets."

        "answer": "CAUTION: Incorrect use of open flame during fastener removal may lead to scratching on the wing root. Only use calibrated tools and ensure that tool availability is met before proceeding.\n\n7.\nSolid Shank Rivets\nA.\nRemoval of Solid Shank Rivets (Refer to Figure 1).\n(1)\nWhen it becomes necessary to replace a rivet, extreme care should be taken in its removal so\nthat the rivet hole will retain its original size and replacement with a larger size rivet will not be\nnecessary. If the rivet is not removed properly, the strength of the joint may be weakened and\nthe replacement of rivets made more difcult.\n(2)\nWhen removing a rivet, work on the manufactured head. It is more symmetrical about the shank\nthan the shop head, and there will be less chance of damaging the rivet hole or the material\naround it. To remove rivets, use hand tools, a power drill or a combination of both. The preferred\nmethod is to drill through the rivet head and drive out the remainder of the rivet with a drift punch.\nFirst, le a at area on the head of any round or brazier head rivet, and center punch the at\nsurface for drilling. On thin metal, back up the rivet on the shop head when center punching\nto avoid depressing the metal. The dimple in 2117-T3 rivets usually eliminates the necessity of\nling and center punching the rivet.\n(3)\nSelect a drill one size smaller than the rivet shank and drill out the rivet head. When using a\npower drill, set the drill on the rivet and rotate the chuck several revolutions by hand before\nturning on the power. This procedure helps the drill cut a good starting spot and eliminates the\nchance of the drill slipping off and tracking across the metal. While holding the drill at a 90Â°\nangle, drill the rivet to the depth of its head. Be careful not to drill too deep because the rivet\nshank will turn with the drill and cause a tear. The rivet head will often break away and climb the\ndrill, which is a good signal to withdraw the drill. If the rivet head does not come lose of its own\naccord, insert a drift punch into the hole and twist slightly to either side until the head comes off.\n(4)\nDrive out the shank of the rivet with a drift punch slightly smaller than the diameter of the shank.\nOn thin metal or unsupported structures, support the sheet with a bucking bar while driving out\nthe shank. If the shank is exceptionally tight after the rivet head is removed, drill the rivet about\ntwo-thirds of the way through the thickness of the material and then drive out the remainder of\nthe rivet with a drift punch.\n(5)\nThe removal of ush rivets is the same as that just described except that no ling of the\nmanufactured head is required before center punching.

NAS1738M4-4\nrivets may be identied as AIA/NAS1738M4-4.\nC.\nInstallation of Solid Shank Rivets.\n(1)\nA large percentage of riveting of airplane structure is accomplished on thin gauge aluminum alloy,\nand the work must be accomplished without distorting or damaging the material with hammer\nblows or riveting tools. All airplane power riveting is accomplished by upsetting the rivets against\na bucking bar instead of striking the shank with a hammer. To prevent deforming the rivet head,\na rivet set must be selected to t each type of rivet. The depth of this set must not touch material\nbeing riveted. Parts requiring heat treatment should be heat treated before riveting, since heat\ntreating process after rivet installation causes warping. Assemblies that require heat treatment\nin a salt bath must be treated prior to assembly, as the salt cannot be entirely washed out of the\njoints.\n(2)\nThe use of hollow rivets in joining highly stressed parts is not permitted. To determine if blind\nrivets may be substituted, refer to Tables 1 and 2. Selection of the proper rivet and the proper\nnumber of rivets is very important. Rivets must be of the proper length for the total thickness of\nthe parts being riveted. Ordinarily, from 1-1/2 to 2 times the diameter of the rivet is the correct\namount for the rivet shank to protrude through the material to form the head. For heavy material,\nsuch as plates or ttings, from 2 to 2-1/2 times the rivet diameter may be used. The rivet should\nnot be excessively loose in the hole, as this condition will cause the rivet to bend over while\nbeing driven, and the shank will not be sufciently expanded to completely ll the hole. A drill\nfrom 0.002 inch to 0.004 inch larger than the rivet shank should be used for sheet and plate\nriveting. Parts should be held rmly together by clamps, screws, or bolts while they are being\ndrilled or riveted. The bucking bar is to be held against the end of the rivet shank. Exercise care\nwhile accomplishing this operation to prevent unseating the rivet by too much pressure. For the\nrst few blows, the bucking bar should be held lightly against the rivet shank so it will receive\nthe impact of the blow through the rivet. The bucking bar must be held square with the rivet\nto produce uniform upsets. As few blows as possible should be struck to properly upset rivet.\nBlows must be as uniform as possible.\nD.\nLoose Or Working Solid Shank Rivets.\n(1)\nRivets which appear to be loose shall be checked with a 0.002 inch feeler gauge by inserting the\ngauge around the head of the rivet in question. If the feeler gauge can be inserted to the shank\nof the rivet, it shall be classied as a loose rivet and it shall be replaced. If the feeler gauge can\nbe inserted approximately halfway to the shank for less than 30 percent of the circumference\nof the rivet head, it shall not be classied as a loose rivet. The feeler gauge shall be used to\ncheck the shear section between the riveted members (such as skin to spar or different sections\nof skins) in a similar manner to that used around the rivet head. If the skin around the brazier\nhead or countersunk rivet can be moved by depressing the skin with nger pressure around the\nrivet, the rivet shall be replaced. If a rivet is found which turns by applying a rotating load to the\nhead of the rivet, it should be replaced.\n(2)\nIn areas where exterior paint has been applied to rivet heads, the paint may harden due to aging\nprocesses and show hairline cracks around the edge of the rivet heads. This should not be\nused as a basis for determining whether or not the rivet is loose. The hardened paint may crack\nat times and collect dirt or exhaust fumes which will appear as discoloration. It is not possible\nto detect loose rivets visually. Replacement rivets should be of like size and type. In some\ninstances, however, it will be necessary to use the next size larger diameter. For general repair\npractices, the spacing between the centerlines of adjacent rivet holes shall be four diameters or\ngreater. In some areas where the spacing between rivets prohibits the use of the next larger\nrivets, special repair instructions and procedures shall be followed.\nContact Cessna Single\nEngine Support."

        "question": "What is the correct procedure for drilling out the rivet head when removing a solid shank rivet, and how can the drill be prevented from slipping off and tracking across the metal?",
        "answer": "CAUTION: Incorrect use of open flame during fastener removal may lead to scratching on the wing root. Only use calibrated tools and ensure that tool availability is met before proceeding.\n\n7.\nSolid Shank Rivets\nA.\nRemoval of Solid Shank Rivets (Refer to Figure 1).\n(1)\nWhen it becomes necessary to replace a rivet, extreme care should be taken in its removal so\nthat the rivet hole will retain its original size and replacement with a larger size rivet will not be\nnecessary. If the rivet is not removed properly, the strength of the joint may be weakened and\nthe replacement of rivets made more difcult.\n(2)\nWhen removing a rivet, work on the manufactured head. It is more symmetrical about the shank\nthan the shop head, and there will be less chance of damaging the rivet hole or the material\naround it. To remove rivets, use hand tools, a power drill or a combination of both. The preferred\nmethod is to drill through the rivet head and drive out the remainder of the rivet with a drift punch.\nFirst, le a at area on the head of any round or brazier head rivet, and center punch the at\nsurface for drilling. On thin metal, back up the rivet on the shop head when center punching\nto avoid depressing the metal. The dimple in 2117-T3 rivets usually eliminates the necessity of\nling and center punching the rivet.\n(3)\nSelect a drill one size smaller than the rivet shank and drill out the rivet head. When using a\npower drill, set the drill on the rivet and rotate the chuck several revolutions by hand before\nturning on the power. This procedure helps the drill cut a good starting spot and eliminates the\nchance of the drill slipping off and tracking across the metal. While holding the drill at a 90Â°\nangle, drill the rivet to the depth of its head. Be careful not to drill too deep because the rivet\nshank will turn with the drill and cause a tear. The rivet head will often break away and climb the\ndrill, which is a good signal to withdraw the drill. If the rivet head does not come lose of its own\naccord, insert a drift punch into the hole and twist slightly to either side until the head comes off.\n(4)\nDrive out the shank of the rivet with a drift punch slightly smaller than the diameter of the shank.\nOn thin metal or unsupported structures, support the sheet with a bucking bar while driving out\nthe shank. If the shank is exceptionally tight after the rivet head is removed, drill the rivet about\ntwo-thirds of the way through the thickness of the material and then drive out the remainder of\nthe rivet with a drift punch.\n(5)\nThe removal of ush rivets is the same as that just described except that no ling of the\nmanufactured head is required before center punching. Be very careful to avoid elongation\nof the dimpled or the countersunk holes. The rivet head should be drilled to approximately\none-half the thickness of the top sheet.\nTable 1.

All airplane power riveting is accomplished by upsetting the rivets against\na bucking bar instead of striking the shank with a hammer. To prevent deforming the rivet head,\na rivet set must be selected to t each type of rivet. The depth of this set must not touch material\nbeing riveted. Parts requiring heat treatment should be heat treated before riveting, since heat\ntreating process after rivet installation causes warping. Assemblies that require heat treatment\nin a salt bath must be treated prior to assembly, as the salt cannot be entirely washed out of the\njoints.\n(2)\nThe use of hollow rivets in joining highly stressed parts is not permitted. To determine if blind\nrivets may be substituted, refer to Tables 1 and 2. Selection of the proper rivet and the proper\nnumber of rivets is very important. Rivets must be of the proper length for the total thickness of\nthe parts being riveted. Ordinarily, from 1-1/2 to 2 times the diameter of the rivet is the correct\namount for the rivet shank to protrude through the material to form the head. For heavy material,\nsuch as plates or ttings, from 2 to 2-1/2 times the rivet diameter may be used. The rivet should\nnot be excessively loose in the hole, as this condition will cause the rivet to bend over while\nbeing driven, and the shank will not be sufciently expanded to completely ll the hole. A drill\nfrom 0.002 inch to 0.004 inch larger than the rivet shank should be used for sheet and plate\nriveting. Parts should be held rmly together by clamps, screws, or bolts while they are being\ndrilled or riveted. The bucking bar is to be held against the end of the rivet shank. Exercise care\nwhile accomplishing this operation to prevent unseating the rivet by too much pressure. For the\nrst few blows, the bucking bar should be held lightly against the rivet shank so it will receive\nthe impact of the blow through the rivet. The bucking bar must be held square with the rivet\nto produce uniform upsets. As few blows as possible should be struck to properly upset rivet.\nBlows must be as uniform as possible.\nD.\nLoose Or Working Solid Shank Rivets.\n(1)\nRivets which appear to be loose shall be checked with a 0.002 inch feeler gauge by inserting the\ngauge around the head of the rivet in question. If the feeler gauge can be inserted to the shank\nof the rivet, it shall be classied as a loose rivet and it shall be replaced. If the feeler gauge can\nbe inserted approximately halfway to the shank for less than 30 percent of the circumference\nof the rivet head, it shall not be classied as a loose rivet. The feeler gauge shall be used to\ncheck the shear section between the riveted members (such as skin to spar or different sections\nof skins) in a similar manner to that used around the rivet head. If the skin around the brazier\nhead or countersunk rivet can be moved by depressing the skin with nger pressure around the\nrivet, the rivet shall be replaced. If a rivet is found which turns by applying a rotating load to the\nhead of the rivet, it should be replaced.\n(2)\nIn areas where exterior paint has been applied to rivet heads, the paint may harden due to aging\nprocesses and show hairline cracks around the edge of the rivet heads. This should not be\nused as a basis for determining whether or not the rivet is loose. The hardened paint may crack\nat times and collect dirt or exhaust fumes which will appear as discoloration. It is not possible\nto detect loose rivets visually. Replacement rivets should be of like size and type. In some\ninstances, however, it will be necessary to use the next size larger diameter. For general repair\npractices, the spacing between the centerlines of adjacent rivet holes shall be four diameters or\ngreater. In some areas where the spacing between rivets prohibits the use of the next larger\nrivets, special repair instructions and procedures shall be followed.\nContact Cessna Single\nEngine Support."

        "answer": "WARNING: solvent cleaners must never be used near fuselage skin due to risk of toxic exposure. Before beginning the sealant application, ensure that the area is free of coolant vapor and personnel are wearing inspection mirror.\n\n2.\nRivets\nA.\nStandard solid shank MS rivets are those generally used in airplane construction.\nThey are\nfabricated in the following head types:\nroundhead, athead, countersunk head, and universal\nhead. Flathead rivets are generally used in the airplane interior, where head clearance is required.\nMS20426 countersunk head rivets are used on the exterior surfaces of the airplane to minimize\nturbulent airow. MS20470 universal head rivets are used on the exterior surfaces of the airplane\nwhere strength requirements necessitate a stronger rivet head than that of the countersunk head\nrivet. Hi-Shear rivets are special, patented rivets having a high shear strength equivalent to that of\nstandard NAS bolts. They are used in special cases in locations where high shear loads are present,\nsuch as in spars, wings, and in heavy bulkhead ribs. This rivet consists of a cadmium plated pin of\nalloy steel. Some have a collar of aluminum alloy. Some of these rivets can be readily identied by\nthe presence of the attached collar in place of the formed head on standard rivets. Blind rivets are\nused, where strength requirements permit, where one side of the structure is inaccessible, making it\nimpossible or impractical to drive standard solid shank rivets."

        "answer": "CAUTION: Before beginning any fastener removal, verify that the fuselage skin is isolated and secured. {Mistake} may result in unnecessary rework or component leakage.\n\n8.\nBlind Rivets\nA.\nGeneral.\n(1)\nBlind rivets are intended for use where access is available to only one side of the work.\n(2)\nReplacement of solid rivets with blind rivets should only be accomplished within the guidelines\nof Table 1, when the installation of a solid shank rivet is not possible. Blind rivets do not have the\nsame resistance to corrosion and fatigue as solid shank rivets, and should not be considered a\nuniversal replacement for solid shank rivets.\nB.\nRemoval of Blind Rivets.\nCAUTION: Do not drill completely through the rivet sleeve. This method of removing\na rivet will tend to enlarge the hole.\n(1)\nUse a small center drill to provide a guide for a larger drill on top of the rivet stem, and drill away\nthe tapered portion of the stem to destroy the lock.\n(2)\nPry the remainder of the locking collar out of the rivet head with a drift punch.\n(3)\nDrill nearly through the head of the rivet using a drill the same size as the rivet shank.\n(4)\nBreak off rivet head, using drift pin inserted into the drilled hole as a pry.\n(5)\nDrive out remaining rivet shank with a pin having a diameter equal to the rivet shank.\nC.\nInstallation of Blind Rivets.\n(1)\nRefer to Figure 2, for an illustration of installation procedures.\n(2)\nCheck that rivet hole size and rivet are compatible.\n(3)\nCheck that proper pulling head is installed on rivet gun.\n(4)\nAdjustment of pulling head must be made in accordance with manufacturers instructions.\n(5)\nCheck that proper operating air pressure is available to rivet gun.\nNOTE:\nBlind rivets may be installed using pneumatic or mechanical guns, whichever is\navailable.\n(6)\nCheck that holes in parts to be fastened are properly aligned.\n(7)\nIn blind clearance applications, check the minimum blind clearance (BK) dimension if the\nmanufactured head of blind rivet is protruding above the top sheet. The rivet will pull down the\nsheet as the stem is pulled if the BK dimension is met or exceeded.\n(8)\nThe minimum blind clearance is the BK dimension, and is listed in the manufacturers standard\nsheets.\nNOTE:\nWhen installing a blind rivet (pull-type rivet) in a hole where the previous blind rivet\nwas removed by drilling and punching the rivet out, inspect the drilled hole to assure\nall metal sheets are in place and not separated prior to pulling rivet.\nIt may be\nnecessary to insert a stiff wire in adjacent hole to hold metal in position while pulling\nrivet.\n(9)\nWhen placing pulling head on rivet stem, hold riveter and pulling head in line with axis of rivet\nwhile holding tool in a light and exible manner.\n(10) When tool is actuated, pulling head will pull down and seat against rivet head.\n(11) Clamping action will pull sheets together and seat rivet when tool is actuated.\n(12) When tool is actuated, action of rivet will automatically assist in bringing tool and pulling head\ninto proper alignment with rivet axis.\nNOTE:\nPressing down with force will not allow rivet and tool to align themselves with hole\nand could limit head setting of rivet, however, enough force to seat the head against\nthe skin is necessary.\n(13) Hold tool in line with rivet as accurately as possible, and allow a steady but light pressure; pull\ntrigger and let the rivet align itself.\n(14) When rivet is completely installed, release trigger and pulling head will eject pulling portion of\nstem through forward end.\n(15) Rivet must break within these limits.\nFastener\nDash number\nStem Flushness\nNAS1738 or NAS1739\nAll\n+0.010 or -0.020 inch\nCherry Max\n-4\n+0.010 or -0.015 inch\nCherry Max\n-5, -6\n+0.010 or -0.020 inch\n(16) Protruding stems usually indicate incorrect grip length or oversize holes.\nD.\nLoose or Working Blind Rivets.\n(1)\nBlind rivets which are found to be loose or show evidence of working must be replaced with\nrivets of like size and type.

        "question": "What are the specific considerations and guidelines for using a drill when removing a solid shank rivet, including the selection of the correct drill size and the technique for preventing the drill from turning with the rivet and causing a tear?",
        "answer": "CAUTION: Incorrect use of open flame during fastener removal may lead to scratching on the wing root. Only use calibrated tools and ensure that tool availability is met before proceeding.\n\n7.\nSolid Shank Rivets\nA.\nRemoval of Solid Shank Rivets (Refer to Figure 1).\n(1)\nWhen it becomes necessary to replace a rivet, extreme care should be taken in its removal so\nthat the rivet hole will retain its original size and replacement with a larger size rivet will not be\nnecessary. If the rivet is not removed properly, the strength of the joint may be weakened and\nthe replacement of rivets made more difcult.\n(2)\nWhen removing a rivet, work on the manufactured head. It is more symmetrical about the shank\nthan the shop head, and there will be less chance of damaging the rivet hole or the material\naround it. To remove rivets, use hand tools, a power drill or a combination of both. The preferred\nmethod is to drill through the rivet head and drive out the remainder of the rivet with a drift punch.\nFirst, le a at area on the head of any round or brazier head rivet, and center punch the at\nsurface for drilling. On thin metal, back up the rivet on the shop head when center punching\nto avoid depressing the metal. The dimple in 2117-T3 rivets usually eliminates the necessity of\nling and center punching the rivet.\n(3)\nSelect a drill one size smaller than the rivet shank and drill out the rivet head. When using a\npower drill, set the drill on the rivet and rotate the chuck several revolutions by hand before\nturning on the power. This procedure helps the drill cut a good starting spot and eliminates the\nchance of the drill slipping off and tracking across the metal. While holding the drill at a 90Â°\nangle, drill the rivet to the depth of its head. Be careful not to drill too deep because the rivet\nshank will turn with the drill and cause a tear. The rivet head will often break away and climb the\ndrill, which is a good signal to withdraw the drill. If the rivet head does not come lose of its own\naccord, insert a drift punch into the hole and twist slightly to either side until the head comes off.\n(4)\nDrive out the shank of the rivet with a drift punch slightly smaller than the diameter of the shank.\nOn thin metal or unsupported structures, support the sheet with a bucking bar while driving out\nthe shank. If the shank is exceptionally tight after the rivet head is removed, drill the rivet about\ntwo-thirds of the way through the thickness of the material and then drive out the remainder of\nthe rivet with a drift punch.\n(5)\nThe removal of ush rivets is the same as that just described except that no ling of the\nmanufactured head is required before center punching. Be very careful to avoid elongation\nof the dimpled or the countersunk holes. The rivet head should be drilled to approximately\none-half the thickness of the top sheet.\nTable 1.

For heavy material,\nsuch as plates or ttings, from 2 to 2-1/2 times the rivet diameter may be used. The rivet should\nnot be excessively loose in the hole, as this condition will cause the rivet to bend over while\nbeing driven, and the shank will not be sufciently expanded to completely ll the hole. A drill\nfrom 0.002 inch to 0.004 inch larger than the rivet shank should be used for sheet and plate\nriveting. Parts should be held rmly together by clamps, screws, or bolts while they are being\ndrilled or riveted. The bucking bar is to be held against the end of the rivet shank. Exercise care\nwhile accomplishing this operation to prevent unseating the rivet by too much pressure. For the\nrst few blows, the bucking bar should be held lightly against the rivet shank so it will receive\nthe impact of the blow through the rivet. The bucking bar must be held square with the rivet\nto produce uniform upsets. As few blows as possible should be struck to properly upset rivet.\nBlows must be as uniform as possible.\nD.\nLoose Or Working Solid Shank Rivets.\n(1)\nRivets which appear to be loose shall be checked with a 0.002 inch feeler gauge by inserting the\ngauge around the head of the rivet in question. If the feeler gauge can be inserted to the shank\nof the rivet, it shall be classied as a loose rivet and it shall be replaced. If the feeler gauge can\nbe inserted approximately halfway to the shank for less than 30 percent of the circumference\nof the rivet head, it shall not be classied as a loose rivet. The feeler gauge shall be used to\ncheck the shear section between the riveted members (such as skin to spar or different sections\nof skins) in a similar manner to that used around the rivet head. If the skin around the brazier\nhead or countersunk rivet can be moved by depressing the skin with nger pressure around the\nrivet, the rivet shall be replaced. If a rivet is found which turns by applying a rotating load to the\nhead of the rivet, it should be replaced.\n(2)\nIn areas where exterior paint has been applied to rivet heads, the paint may harden due to aging\nprocesses and show hairline cracks around the edge of the rivet heads. This should not be\nused as a basis for determining whether or not the rivet is loose. The hardened paint may crack\nat times and collect dirt or exhaust fumes which will appear as discoloration. It is not possible\nto detect loose rivets visually. Replacement rivets should be of like size and type. In some\ninstances, however, it will be necessary to use the next size larger diameter. For general repair\npractices, the spacing between the centerlines of adjacent rivet holes shall be four diameters or\ngreater. In some areas where the spacing between rivets prohibits the use of the next larger\nrivets, special repair instructions and procedures shall be followed.\nContact Cessna Single\nEngine Support."

        "answer": "NOTE: If the engine nacelle shows any signs of cracks, do not proceed with the panel replacement until proper inspection and corrective action have been taken.\n\n9.\nSpacing Of Rivets\nA.\nThere are no specic rules which are applicable to every case or type of riveting. There are, however,\ncertain general rules which should be understood and followed. Edge distance of rivets should not\nbe less than two diameters of the rivet, measured from the edge of the sheet or plate to the center of\nthe rivet hole. Spacing between rivets, when in rows, depends upon several factors, principally the\nthickness of the sheet, the diameter of the rivets, and the manner in which the sheet will be stressed.\nThis spacing is seldom less than four diameters of the rivet, measured between the centers of the rivet\nholes. Rivets, spaced four diameters apart, are found in certain seams of semimonocoque fuselages,\nwebs or built up spars, and various plates or ttings. Where there are two rows of rivets, they are\nusually staggered. The transverse pitch or distance between rows should be slightly less than the\npitch of the rivets, with 75 percent of the rivet pitch being the usual practice. An average spacing or\npitch of rivets in the cover or skin of most structures, except at highly stressed points, will be from 6\nto 12 diameters of the rivet. The best practice in repair is to make pitch of rivets equal to those in the\noriginal structure."

        "question": "What happens to the rivet shank when it is overdriven during the installation of non-metallic parts, and how can this issue be mitigated?",
        "answer": "NOTE: This procedure applies specifically to aircraft models with engine nacelle configurations post-2015. For older models, refer to AMM revision 22B or later. Always verify tool availability before beginning.\n\n11.\nRivets for Plastic or Composite Parts\nA.\nUnlike rivets in metallic joints, blind rivets are often the rivet of choice for riveting non-metallic materials\nbecause they may be installed without the hammering necessary to install solid rivets. If the tail end\nof the rivet is adjacent to the non-metal side, install a washer over the shank to prevent the \"hole\nlling\" action built into blind rivets from overloading the non-metal hole. The hole in the washer should\nmatch the specied installation hole for the fastener. If the tail end of the rivet is installed through\nmetal substructure, the washer is not necessary.\nB.\nSoft (\"A\" 1100 aluminum shank rivets or \"B\" 5056 aluminum shank) rivets are also used to install non-\nmetallic parts. Original equipment soft rivets will be either red or green colored under the paint. If the\nbutt or driven end of the rivet is adjacent to the non-metallic part, it is preferable to install a washer over\nthe shank to prevent the rivet shank, which swells during driving, from overloading the non-metallic\nhole. The hole in the washer should match the specied installation hole for the fastener. If the tail\nend of the rivet is installed through metal substructure, the washer is not necessary. Take care when\ndriving rivets through non-metal to not overdrive the rivet. If the rivet is overdriven, the shank will swell\neven with the washer in place. The rivet butt should be driven to no more than necessary to retain\nthe part, never more than 1.4 times the shank diameter.\nC.\nIf the original equipment rivet provided connection between metal parts as well as non-metallic parts,\nit may be a standard (AD) rivet. Original equipment AD rivets are colored gold or uncolored. Replace\noriginal equipment AD rivets with AD rivets.\n"

        "answer": "WARNING: ventilate area. Failure to secure all panels before fastener removal may lead to fire hazard. Always inspect the wing root and verify that aircraft model.\n\n4.\nSubstitution Of Rivets\nA.\nWhen adapting the typical repairs shown in this manual to suit actual conditions, it may be necessary\nto use different fasteners than those originally used. This may be due to non-availability of a particular\nfastener, restricted access, or other difculties. When replacing rivets, it is desirable to use rivets\nidentical to the type of rivet removed. Countersunk head rivets are to be replaced by rivets of the\nsame type and degree of countersink. When rivet holes become enlarged, deformed, or otherwise\ndamaged, several options are available.\n(1)\nThe simplest solution is to install a 1/32 inch (0.032 inch) larger size rivet as a replacement. This\nsolution uses the designed repairability of the structure, and is the quickest repair.\n(2)\nRepair rivets are available.\n(a)\nRepair rivets have a shank that is 1/64 inch (0.016 inch) larger diameter than a standard\nrivet but have the same size and shape heads.\n(b)\nNAS1241 repair rivets replace MS20426 rivets if they have the same sufx.\n(c)\nNAS1242 repair rivets replace MS20470 rivets if they have the same sufx.\n(d)\nNAS1738, NAS1939 and some NAS9301 through NAS9311 blind rivets also have oversize\nshanks.\nB.\nReplacement shall not be made with rivets of lower strength material.\nC.\nHi-Shear Rivets.\n(1)\nWhen Hi-Shear rivets are not available, replacement of sizes 3/16 inch or greater rivets shall be\nmade with bolts of equal or greater strength than the rivet being replaced, and with self-locking\nnuts of the same diameter. It is permissible to replace Hi-Shear rivets with Hi-Lok bolts of the\nsame material, diameter and grip length.\nD.\nBlind Rivets.\n(1)\nBlind rivets have higher deection rates in shear than standard solid rivets, are more susceptible\nto fatigue failure and are not as strong as solid rivets in thin sheets. For this reason, it is not\nadvisable to replace any considerable number of solid rivets in a given joint by blind rivets,\nbecause this may result in overstressing the remaining solid rivets. The hollow blind rivet shall\nnot be used. The blind rivet shall be of the same or greater strength than the rivet it replaces. In\ncases of dimpled assemblies (the process of forming the metal around a hole to form a conical\nindentation to receive the tapered head of a ush rivet or a screw), the rivet holes shall be\ndrilled after the sheets are dimpled. When possible, the exposed end of each clipped plug\nshall be coated with epoxy primer. Blind rivets shall not be used in fuel bay areas except in\ncases of absolute necessity, and must be sealed. If blind fasteners other than blind rivets are\nencountered, it is recommended that replacements be made with identical fasteners.\nE.\nFor a list of approved solid shank and Hi-Shear rivet substitutions, refer to Tables 1 and 2."

        "question": "What is the procedure for checking if a solid shank rivet is loose, and what tools should be used to determine if it needs to be replaced?",
        "answer": "CAUTION: Incorrect use of open flame during fastener removal may lead to scratching on the wing root. Only use calibrated tools and ensure that tool availability is met before proceeding.\n\n7.\nSolid Shank Rivets\nA.\nRemoval of Solid Shank Rivets (Refer to Figure 1).\n(1)\nWhen it becomes necessary to replace a rivet, extreme care should be taken in its removal so\nthat the rivet hole will retain its original size and replacement with a larger size rivet will not be\nnecessary. If the rivet is not removed properly, the strength of the joint may be weakened and\nthe replacement of rivets made more difcult.\n(2)\nWhen removing a rivet, work on the manufactured head. It is more symmetrical about the shank\nthan the shop head, and there will be less chance of damaging the rivet hole or the material\naround it. To remove rivets, use hand tools, a power drill or a combination of both. The preferred\nmethod is to drill through the rivet head and drive out the remainder of the rivet with a drift punch.\nFirst, le a at area on the head of any round or brazier head rivet, and center punch the at\nsurface for drilling. On thin metal, back up the rivet on the shop head when center punching\nto avoid depressing the metal. The dimple in 2117-T3 rivets usually eliminates the necessity of\nling and center punching the rivet.\n(3)\nSelect a drill one size smaller than the rivet shank and drill out the rivet head. When using a\npower drill, set the drill on the rivet and rotate the chuck several revolutions by hand before\nturning on the power. This procedure helps the drill cut a good starting spot and eliminates the\nchance of the drill slipping off and tracking across the metal. While holding the drill at a 90Â°\nangle, drill the rivet to the depth of its head. Be careful not to drill too deep because the rivet\nshank will turn with the drill and cause a tear. The rivet head will often break away and climb the\ndrill, which is a good signal to withdraw the drill. If the rivet head does not come lose of its own\naccord, insert a drift punch into the hole and twist slightly to either side until the head comes off.\n(4)\nDrive out the shank of the rivet with a drift punch slightly smaller than the diameter of the shank.\nOn thin metal or unsupported structures, support the sheet with a bucking bar while driving out\nthe shank. If the shank is exceptionally tight after the rivet head is removed, drill the rivet about\ntwo-thirds of the way through the thickness of the material and then drive out the remainder of\nthe rivet with a drift punch.\n(5)\nThe removal of ush rivets is the same as that just described except that no ling of the\nmanufactured head is required before center punching. Be very careful to avoid elongation\nof the dimpled or the countersunk holes. The rivet head should be drilled to approximately\none-half the thickness of the top sheet.\nTable 1.

NAS1738M4-4\nrivets may be identied as AIA/NAS1738M4-4.\nC.\nInstallation of Solid Shank Rivets.\n(1)\nA large percentage of riveting of airplane structure is accomplished on thin gauge aluminum alloy,\nand the work must be accomplished without distorting or damaging the material with hammer\nblows or riveting tools. All airplane power riveting is accomplished by upsetting the rivets against\na bucking bar instead of striking the shank with a hammer. To prevent deforming the rivet head,\na rivet set must be selected to t each type of rivet. The depth of this set must not touch material\nbeing riveted. Parts requiring heat treatment should be heat treated before riveting, since heat\ntreating process after rivet installation causes warping. Assemblies that require heat treatment\nin a salt bath must be treated prior to assembly, as the salt cannot be entirely washed out of the\njoints.\n(2)\nThe use of hollow rivets in joining highly stressed parts is not permitted. To determine if blind\nrivets may be substituted, refer to Tables 1 and 2. Selection of the proper rivet and the proper\nnumber of rivets is very important. Rivets must be of the proper length for the total thickness of\nthe parts being riveted. Ordinarily, from 1-1/2 to 2 times the diameter of the rivet is the correct\namount for the rivet shank to protrude through the material to form the head. For heavy material,\nsuch as plates or ttings, from 2 to 2-1/2 times the rivet diameter may be used. The rivet should\nnot be excessively loose in the hole, as this condition will cause the rivet to bend over while\nbeing driven, and the shank will not be sufciently expanded to completely ll the hole. A drill\nfrom 0.002 inch to 0.004 inch larger than the rivet shank should be used for sheet and plate\nriveting. Parts should be held rmly together by clamps, screws, or bolts while they are being\ndrilled or riveted. The bucking bar is to be held against the end of the rivet shank. Exercise care\nwhile accomplishing this operation to prevent unseating the rivet by too much pressure.

        "question": "What precautions should be taken when installing solid shank rivets in thin gauge aluminum alloy to prevent distorting or damaging the material?",
        "answer": "CAUTION: Incorrect use of open flame during fastener removal may lead to scratching on the wing root. Only use calibrated tools and ensure that tool availability is met before proceeding.\n\n7.\nSolid Shank Rivets\nA.\nRemoval of Solid Shank Rivets (Refer to Figure 1).\n(1)\nWhen it becomes necessary to replace a rivet, extreme care should be taken in its removal so\nthat the rivet hole will retain its original size and replacement with a larger size rivet will not be\nnecessary. If the rivet is not removed properly, the strength of the joint may be weakened and\nthe replacement of rivets made more difcult.\n(2)\nWhen removing a rivet, work on the manufactured head. It is more symmetrical about the shank\nthan the shop head, and there will be less chance of damaging the rivet hole or the material\naround it. To remove rivets, use hand tools, a power drill or a combination of both. The preferred\nmethod is to drill through the rivet head and drive out the remainder of the rivet with a drift punch.\nFirst, le a at area on the head of any round or brazier head rivet, and center punch the at\nsurface for drilling. On thin metal, back up the rivet on the shop head when center punching\nto avoid depressing the metal. The dimple in 2117-T3 rivets usually eliminates the necessity of\nling and center punching the rivet.\n(3)\nSelect a drill one size smaller than the rivet shank and drill out the rivet head. When using a\npower drill, set the drill on the rivet and rotate the chuck several revolutions by hand before\nturning on the power. This procedure helps the drill cut a good starting spot and eliminates the\nchance of the drill slipping off and tracking across the metal. While holding the drill at a 90Â°\nangle, drill the rivet to the depth of its head. Be careful not to drill too deep because the rivet\nshank will turn with the drill and cause a tear. The rivet head will often break away and climb the\ndrill, which is a good signal to withdraw the drill. If the rivet head does not come lose of its own\naccord, insert a drift punch into the hole and twist slightly to either side until the head comes off.\n(4)\nDrive out the shank of the rivet with a drift punch slightly smaller than the diameter of the shank.\nOn thin metal or unsupported structures, support the sheet with a bucking bar while driving out\nthe shank. If the shank is exceptionally tight after the rivet head is removed, drill the rivet about\ntwo-thirds of the way through the thickness of the material and then drive out the remainder of\nthe rivet with a drift punch.\n(5)\nThe removal of ush rivets is the same as that just described except that no ling of the\nmanufactured head is required before center punching. Be very careful to avoid elongation\nof the dimpled or the countersunk holes. The rivet head should be drilled to approximately\none-half the thickness of the top sheet.\nTable 1.

NAS1738M4-4\nrivets may be identied as AIA/NAS1738M4-4.\nC.\nInstallation of Solid Shank Rivets.\n(1)\nA large percentage of riveting of airplane structure is accomplished on thin gauge aluminum alloy,\nand the work must be accomplished without distorting or damaging the material with hammer\nblows or riveting tools. All airplane power riveting is accomplished by upsetting the rivets against\na bucking bar instead of striking the shank with a hammer. To prevent deforming the rivet head,\na rivet set must be selected to t each type of rivet. The depth of this set must not touch material\nbeing riveted. Parts requiring heat treatment should be heat treated before riveting, since heat\ntreating process after rivet installation causes warping. Assemblies that require heat treatment\nin a salt bath must be treated prior to assembly, as the salt cannot be entirely washed out of the\njoints.\n(2)\nThe use of hollow rivets in joining highly stressed parts is not permitted. To determine if blind\nrivets may be substituted, refer to Tables 1 and 2. Selection of the proper rivet and the proper\nnumber of rivets is very important. Rivets must be of the proper length for the total thickness of\nthe parts being riveted. Ordinarily, from 1-1/2 to 2 times the diameter of the rivet is the correct\namount for the rivet shank to protrude through the material to form the head. For heavy material,\nsuch as plates or ttings, from 2 to 2-1/2 times the rivet diameter may be used. The rivet should\nnot be excessively loose in the hole, as this condition will cause the rivet to bend over while\nbeing driven, and the shank will not be sufciently expanded to completely ll the hole. A drill\nfrom 0.002 inch to 0.004 inch larger than the rivet shank should be used for sheet and plate\nriveting. Parts should be held rmly together by clamps, screws, or bolts while they are being\ndrilled or riveted. The bucking bar is to be held against the end of the rivet shank. Exercise care\nwhile accomplishing this operation to prevent unseating the rivet by too much pressure. For the\nrst few blows, the bucking bar should be held lightly against the rivet shank so it will receive\nthe impact of the blow through the rivet. The bucking bar must be held square with the rivet\nto produce uniform upsets. As few blows as possible should be struck to properly upset rivet.\nBlows must be as uniform as possible.\nD.\nLoose Or Working Solid Shank Rivets.\n(1)\nRivets which appear to be loose shall be checked with a 0.002 inch feeler gauge by inserting the\ngauge around the head of the rivet in question. If the feeler gauge can be inserted to the shank\nof the rivet, it shall be classied as a loose rivet and it shall be replaced. If the feeler gauge can\nbe inserted approximately halfway to the shank for less than 30 percent of the circumference\nof the rivet head, it shall not be classied as a loose rivet. The feeler gauge shall be used to\ncheck the shear section between the riveted members (such as skin to spar or different sections\nof skins) in a similar manner to that used around the rivet head. If the skin around the brazier\nhead or countersunk rivet can be moved by depressing the skin with nger pressure around the\nrivet, the rivet shall be replaced. If a rivet is found which turns by applying a rotating load to the\nhead of the rivet, it should be replaced.\n(2)\nIn areas where exterior paint has been applied to rivet heads, the paint may harden due to aging\nprocesses and show hairline cracks around the edge of the rivet heads. This should not be\nused as a basis for determining whether or not the rivet is loose. The hardened paint may crack\nat times and collect dirt or exhaust fumes which will appear as discoloration. It is not possible\nto detect loose rivets visually. Replacement rivets should be of like size and type. In some\ninstances, however, it will be necessary to use the next size larger diameter. For general repair\npractices, the spacing between the centerlines of adjacent rivet holes shall be four diameters or\ngreater. In some areas where the spacing between rivets prohibits the use of the next larger\nrivets, special repair instructions and procedures shall be followed.\nContact Cessna Single\nEngine Support."

        "answer": "WARNING: Inadequate panel replacement of the engine nacelle may compromise aircraft integrity. Always wear insulated gloves, follow approved methods, and check for discoloration before returning to service.\n\n1.\nGeneral\nA.\nFasteners used in the airplane are generally solid aluminum rivets, blind rivets, and steel threaded\nfasteners. Usage of each is primarily a function of the loads to be carried, accessibility and frequency\nof removal. Rivets used in airplane construction are usually fabricated from aluminum alloys.

There are, however,\ncertain general rules which should be understood and followed. Edge distance of rivets should not\nbe less than two diameters of the rivet, measured from the edge of the sheet or plate to the center of\nthe rivet hole. Spacing between rivets, when in rows, depends upon several factors, principally the\nthickness of the sheet, the diameter of the rivets, and the manner in which the sheet will be stressed.\nThis spacing is seldom less than four diameters of the rivet, measured between the centers of the rivet\nholes. Rivets, spaced four diameters apart, are found in certain seams of semimonocoque fuselages,\nwebs or built up spars, and various plates or ttings. Where there are two rows of rivets, they are\nusually staggered. The transverse pitch or distance between rows should be slightly less than the\npitch of the rivets, with 75 percent of the rivet pitch being the usual practice. An average spacing or\npitch of rivets in the cover or skin of most structures, except at highly stressed points, will be from 6\nto 12 diameters of the rivet.

        "question": "What is the rationale behind using a 1/32 inch larger size rivet as a replacement when rivet holes become enlarged, deformed, or otherwise damaged, and how does this solution relate to the designed repairability of the structure?",
        "answer": "WARNING: ventilate area. Failure to secure all panels before fastener removal may lead to fire hazard. Always inspect the wing root and verify that aircraft model.\n\n4.\nSubstitution Of Rivets\nA.\nWhen adapting the typical repairs shown in this manual to suit actual conditions, it may be necessary\nto use different fasteners than those originally used. This may be due to non-availability of a particular\nfastener, restricted access, or other difculties. When replacing rivets, it is desirable to use rivets\nidentical to the type of rivet removed. Countersunk head rivets are to be replaced by rivets of the\nsame type and degree of countersink. When rivet holes become enlarged, deformed, or otherwise\ndamaged, several options are available.\n(1)\nThe simplest solution is to install a 1/32 inch (0.032 inch) larger size rivet as a replacement. This\nsolution uses the designed repairability of the structure, and is the quickest repair.\n(2)\nRepair rivets are available.\n(a)\nRepair rivets have a shank that is 1/64 inch (0.016 inch) larger diameter than a standard\nrivet but have the same size and shape heads.\n(b)\nNAS1241 repair rivets replace MS20426 rivets if they have the same sufx.\n(c)\nNAS1242 repair rivets replace MS20470 rivets if they have the same sufx.\n(d)\nNAS1738, NAS1939 and some NAS9301 through NAS9311 blind rivets also have oversize\nshanks.\nB.\nReplacement shall not be made with rivets of lower strength material.\nC.\nHi-Shear Rivets.\n(1)\nWhen Hi-Shear rivets are not available, replacement of sizes 3/16 inch or greater rivets shall be\nmade with bolts of equal or greater strength than the rivet being replaced, and with self-locking\nnuts of the same diameter. It is permissible to replace Hi-Shear rivets with Hi-Lok bolts of the\nsame material, diameter and grip length.\nD.\nBlind Rivets.\n(1)\nBlind rivets have higher deection rates in shear than standard solid rivets, are more susceptible\nto fatigue failure and are not as strong as solid rivets in thin sheets. For this reason, it is not\nadvisable to replace any considerable number of solid rivets in a given joint by blind rivets,\nbecause this may result in overstressing the remaining solid rivets. The hollow blind rivet shall\nnot be used. The blind rivet shall be of the same or greater strength than the rivet it replaces. In\ncases of dimpled assemblies (the process of forming the metal around a hole to form a conical\nindentation to receive the tapered head of a ush rivet or a screw), the rivet holes shall be\ndrilled after the sheets are dimpled. When possible, the exposed end of each clipped plug\nshall be coated with epoxy primer. Blind rivets shall not be used in fuel bay areas except in\ncases of absolute necessity, and must be sealed. If blind fasteners other than blind rivets are\nencountered, it is recommended that replacements be made with identical fasteners.\nE.\nFor a list of approved solid shank and Hi-Shear rivet substitutions, refer to Tables 1 and 2."

        "question": "What is the minimum number of diameters of the rivet that the edge distance of rivets should not be less than, when measured from the edge of the sheet or plate to the center of the rivet hole?",
        "answer": "NOTE: If the engine nacelle shows any signs of cracks, do not proceed with the panel replacement until proper inspection and corrective action have been taken.\n\n9.\nSpacing Of Rivets\nA.\nThere are no specic rules which are applicable to every case or type of riveting. There are, however,\ncertain general rules which should be understood and followed. Edge distance of rivets should not\nbe less than two diameters of the rivet, measured from the edge of the sheet or plate to the center of\nthe rivet hole. Spacing between rivets, when in rows, depends upon several factors, principally the\nthickness of the sheet, the diameter of the rivets, and the manner in which the sheet will be stressed.\nThis spacing is seldom less than four diameters of the rivet, measured between the centers of the rivet\nholes. Rivets, spaced four diameters apart, are found in certain seams of semimonocoque fuselages,\nwebs or built up spars, and various plates or ttings. Where there are two rows of rivets, they are\nusually staggered. The transverse pitch or distance between rows should be slightly less than the\npitch of the rivets, with 75 percent of the rivet pitch being the usual practice. An average spacing or\npitch of rivets in the cover or skin of most structures, except at highly stressed points, will be from 6\nto 12 diameters of the rivet. The best practice in repair is to make pitch of rivets equal to those in the\noriginal structure."

        "answer": "WARNING: Operating the fuselage skin without confirming aircraft model can result in loss of control. Carefully evacuate personnel, and consult section 05-20-00 of the maintenance manual for proper panel replacement steps.\n\n6.\nRivet Lengths\nA.\nProper length of rivets is an important part of a repair. Should too long a rivet be used, the formed\nhead will be too large, or the rivet may bend or be forced between the sheets being riveted. Should\ntoo short a rivet be used, the formed head will be too small or the riveted material will be damaged.\nIf proper length rivets are not available, longer rivets may be cut off to equal the proper length (not\ngrip). Rivet length is based on the grip."

        "answer": "WARNING: Inadequate panel replacement of the engine nacelle may compromise aircraft integrity. Always wear insulated gloves, follow approved methods, and check for discoloration before returning to service.\n\n1.\nGeneral\nA.\nFasteners used in the airplane are generally solid aluminum rivets, blind rivets, and steel threaded\nfasteners. Usage of each is primarily a function of the loads to be carried, accessibility and frequency\nof removal. Rivets used in airplane construction are usually fabricated from aluminum alloys. In\nspecial cases, monel, corrosion-resistant steel and mild steel, copper, and iron rivets are used."

        "question": "What are the implications of using blind rivets in the engine air induction system structure, and what alternative fasteners are recommended in such cases?",
        "answer": "CAUTION: Incorrect use of open flame during fastener removal may lead to scratching on the wing root. Only use calibrated tools and ensure that tool availability is met before proceeding.\n\n7.\nSolid Shank Rivets\nA.\nRemoval of Solid Shank Rivets (Refer to Figure 1).\n(1)\nWhen it becomes necessary to replace a rivet, extreme care should be taken in its removal so\nthat the rivet hole will retain its original size and replacement with a larger size rivet will not be\nnecessary. If the rivet is not removed properly, the strength of the joint may be weakened and\nthe replacement of rivets made more difcult.\n(2)\nWhen removing a rivet, work on the manufactured head. It is more symmetrical about the shank\nthan the shop head, and there will be less chance of damaging the rivet hole or the material\naround it. To remove rivets, use hand tools, a power drill or a combination of both. The preferred\nmethod is to drill through the rivet head and drive out the remainder of the rivet with a drift punch.\nFirst, le a at area on the head of any round or brazier head rivet, and center punch the at\nsurface for drilling. On thin metal, back up the rivet on the shop head when center punching\nto avoid depressing the metal. The dimple in 2117-T3 rivets usually eliminates the necessity of\nling and center punching the rivet.\n(3)\nSelect a drill one size smaller than the rivet shank and drill out the rivet head. When using a\npower drill, set the drill on the rivet and rotate the chuck several revolutions by hand before\nturning on the power. This procedure helps the drill cut a good starting spot and eliminates the\nchance of the drill slipping off and tracking across the metal. While holding the drill at a 90Â°\nangle, drill the rivet to the depth of its head. Be careful not to drill too deep because the rivet\nshank will turn with the drill and cause a tear. The rivet head will often break away and climb the\ndrill, which is a good signal to withdraw the drill. If the rivet head does not come lose of its own\naccord, insert a drift punch into the hole and twist slightly to either side until the head comes off.\n(4)\nDrive out the shank of the rivet with a drift punch slightly smaller than the diameter of the shank.\nOn thin metal or unsupported structures, support the sheet with a bucking bar while driving out\nthe shank. If the shank is exceptionally tight after the rivet head is removed, drill the rivet about\ntwo-thirds of the way through the thickness of the material and then drive out the remainder of\nthe rivet with a drift punch.\n(5)\nThe removal of ush rivets is the same as that just described except that no ling of the\nmanufactured head is required before center punching. Be very careful to avoid elongation\nof the dimpled or the countersunk holes. The rivet head should be drilled to approximately\none-half the thickness of the top sheet.\nTable 1.

Identical\nparts may have MS, NASM or AIA/NAS part numbers.\nEXAMPLE:\nMS20470AD4-6 rivets may also be identied as NASM20470AD4-6. NAS1738M4-4\nrivets may be identied as AIA/NAS1738M4-4.\nC.\nInstallation of Solid Shank Rivets.\n(1)\nA large percentage of riveting of airplane structure is accomplished on thin gauge aluminum alloy,\nand the work must be accomplished without distorting or damaging the material with hammer\nblows or riveting tools. All airplane power riveting is accomplished by upsetting the rivets against\na bucking bar instead of striking the shank with a hammer. To prevent deforming the rivet head,\na rivet set must be selected to t each type of rivet. The depth of this set must not touch material\nbeing riveted. Parts requiring heat treatment should be heat treated before riveting, since heat\ntreating process after rivet installation causes warping. Assemblies that require heat treatment\nin a salt bath must be treated prior to assembly, as the salt cannot be entirely washed out of the\njoints.\n(2)\nThe use of hollow rivets in joining highly stressed parts is not permitted. To determine if blind\nrivets may be substituted, refer to Tables 1 and 2. Selection of the proper rivet and the proper\nnumber of rivets is very important. Rivets must be of the proper length for the total thickness of\nthe parts being riveted. Ordinarily, from 1-1/2 to 2 times the diameter of the rivet is the correct\namount for the rivet shank to protrude through the material to form the head. For heavy material,\nsuch as plates or ttings, from 2 to 2-1/2 times the rivet diameter may be used. The rivet should\nnot be excessively loose in the hole, as this condition will cause the rivet to bend over while\nbeing driven, and the shank will not be sufciently expanded to completely ll the hole. A drill\nfrom 0.002 inch to 0.004 inch larger than the rivet shank should be used for sheet and plate\nriveting. Parts should be held rmly together by clamps, screws, or bolts while they are being\ndrilled or riveted. The bucking bar is to be held against the end of the rivet shank. Exercise care\nwhile accomplishing this operation to prevent unseating the rivet by too much pressure. For the\nrst few blows, the bucking bar should be held lightly against the rivet shank so it will receive\nthe impact of the blow through the rivet. The bucking bar must be held square with the rivet\nto produce uniform upsets. As few blows as possible should be struck to properly upset rivet.\nBlows must be as uniform as possible.\nD.\nLoose Or Working Solid Shank Rivets.\n(1)\nRivets which appear to be loose shall be checked with a 0.002 inch feeler gauge by inserting the\ngauge around the head of the rivet in question. If the feeler gauge can be inserted to the shank\nof the rivet, it shall be classied as a loose rivet and it shall be replaced. If the feeler gauge can\nbe inserted approximately halfway to the shank for less than 30 percent of the circumference\nof the rivet head, it shall not be classied as a loose rivet. The feeler gauge shall be used to\ncheck the shear section between the riveted members (such as skin to spar or different sections\nof skins) in a similar manner to that used around the rivet head. If the skin around the brazier\nhead or countersunk rivet can be moved by depressing the skin with nger pressure around the\nrivet, the rivet shall be replaced. If a rivet is found which turns by applying a rotating load to the\nhead of the rivet, it should be replaced.\n(2)\nIn areas where exterior paint has been applied to rivet heads, the paint may harden due to aging\nprocesses and show hairline cracks around the edge of the rivet heads. This should not be\nused as a basis for determining whether or not the rivet is loose. The hardened paint may crack\nat times and collect dirt or exhaust fumes which will appear as discoloration. It is not possible\nto detect loose rivets visually. Replacement rivets should be of like size and type. In some\ninstances, however, it will be necessary to use the next size larger diameter. For general repair\npractices, the spacing between the centerlines of adjacent rivet holes shall be four diameters or\ngreater. In some areas where the spacing between rivets prohibits the use of the next larger\nrivets, special repair instructions and procedures shall be followed.\nContact Cessna Single\nEngine Support."

        "answer": "CAUTION: Before beginning any fastener removal, verify that the fuselage skin is isolated and secured. {Mistake} may result in unnecessary rework or component leakage.\n\n8.\nBlind Rivets\nA.\nGeneral.\n(1)\nBlind rivets are intended for use where access is available to only one side of the work.\n(2)\nReplacement of solid rivets with blind rivets should only be accomplished within the guidelines\nof Table 1, when the installation of a solid shank rivet is not possible. Blind rivets do not have the\nsame resistance to corrosion and fatigue as solid shank rivets, and should not be considered a\nuniversal replacement for solid shank rivets.\nB.\nRemoval of Blind Rivets.\nCAUTION: Do not drill completely through the rivet sleeve. This method of removing\na rivet will tend to enlarge the hole.\n(1)\nUse a small center drill to provide a guide for a larger drill on top of the rivet stem, and drill away\nthe tapered portion of the stem to destroy the lock.\n(2)\nPry the remainder of the locking collar out of the rivet head with a drift punch.\n(3)\nDrill nearly through the head of the rivet using a drill the same size as the rivet shank.\n(4)\nBreak off rivet head, using drift pin inserted into the drilled hole as a pry.\n(5)\nDrive out remaining rivet shank with a pin having a diameter equal to the rivet shank.\nC.\nInstallation of Blind Rivets.\n(1)\nRefer to Figure 2, for an illustration of installation procedures.\n(2)\nCheck that rivet hole size and rivet are compatible.\n(3)\nCheck that proper pulling head is installed on rivet gun.\n(4)\nAdjustment of pulling head must be made in accordance with manufacturers instructions.\n(5)\nCheck that proper operating air pressure is available to rivet gun.\nNOTE:\nBlind rivets may be installed using pneumatic or mechanical guns, whichever is\navailable.\n(6)\nCheck that holes in parts to be fastened are properly aligned.\n(7)\nIn blind clearance applications, check the minimum blind clearance (BK) dimension if the\nmanufactured head of blind rivet is protruding above the top sheet. The rivet will pull down the\nsheet as the stem is pulled if the BK dimension is met or exceeded.\n(8)\nThe minimum blind clearance is the BK dimension, and is listed in the manufacturers standard\nsheets.\nNOTE:\nWhen installing a blind rivet (pull-type rivet) in a hole where the previous blind rivet\nwas removed by drilling and punching the rivet out, inspect the drilled hole to assure\nall metal sheets are in place and not separated prior to pulling rivet.\nIt may be\nnecessary to insert a stiff wire in adjacent hole to hold metal in position while pulling\nrivet.\n(9)\nWhen placing pulling head on rivet stem, hold riveter and pulling head in line with axis of rivet\nwhile holding tool in a light and exible manner.\n(10) When tool is actuated, pulling head will pull down and seat against rivet head.\n(11) Clamping action will pull sheets together and seat rivet when tool is actuated.\n(12) When tool is actuated, action of rivet will automatically assist in bringing tool and pulling head\ninto proper alignment with rivet axis.\nNOTE:\nPressing down with force will not allow rivet and tool to align themselves with hole\nand could limit head setting of rivet, however, enough force to seat the head against\nthe skin is necessary.\n(13) Hold tool in line with rivet as accurately as possible, and allow a steady but light pressure; pull\ntrigger and let the rivet align itself.\n(14) When rivet is completely installed, release trigger and pulling head will eject pulling portion of\nstem through forward end.\n(15) Rivet must break within these limits.\nFastener\nDash number\nStem Flushness\nNAS1738 or NAS1739\nAll\n+0.010 or -0.020 inch\nCherry Max\n-4\n+0.010 or -0.015 inch\nCherry Max\n-5, -6\n+0.010 or -0.020 inch\n(16) Protruding stems usually indicate incorrect grip length or oversize holes.\nD.\nLoose or Working Blind Rivets.\n(1)\nBlind rivets which are found to be loose or show evidence of working must be replaced with\nrivets of like size and type. In some instances, it may be necessary to use the next larger size\nrivet. Loose fasteners may be indicated by the following situation:\n(a)\nThe fastened material moves relative to the fastener. Skin deection is evident.\n(b)\nTipping of the fastener head may indicate its looseness or slippage.

There are, however,\ncertain general rules which should be understood and followed. Edge distance of rivets should not\nbe less than two diameters of the rivet, measured from the edge of the sheet or plate to the center of\nthe rivet hole. Spacing between rivets, when in rows, depends upon several factors, principally the\nthickness of the sheet, the diameter of the rivets, and the manner in which the sheet will be stressed.\nThis spacing is seldom less than four diameters of the rivet, measured between the centers of the rivet\nholes. Rivets, spaced four diameters apart, are found in certain seams of semimonocoque fuselages,\nwebs or built up spars, and various plates or ttings. Where there are two rows of rivets, they are\nusually staggered. The transverse pitch or distance between rows should be slightly less than the\npitch of the rivets, with 75 percent of the rivet pitch being the usual practice. An average spacing or\npitch of rivets in the cover or skin of most structures, except at highly stressed points, will be from 6\nto 12 diameters of the rivet. The best practice in repair is to make pitch of rivets equal to those in the\noriginal structure."

        "question": "What are the guidelines for determining the correct length of a rivet for the total thickness of the parts being riveted, and how much should the rivet shank protrude through the material to form the head?",
        "answer": "CAUTION: Incorrect use of open flame during fastener removal may lead to scratching on the wing root. Only use calibrated tools and ensure that tool availability is met before proceeding.\n\n7.\nSolid Shank Rivets\nA.\nRemoval of Solid Shank Rivets (Refer to Figure 1).\n(1)\nWhen it becomes necessary to replace a rivet, extreme care should be taken in its removal so\nthat the rivet hole will retain its original size and replacement with a larger size rivet will not be\nnecessary. If the rivet is not removed properly, the strength of the joint may be weakened and\nthe replacement of rivets made more difcult.\n(2)\nWhen removing a rivet, work on the manufactured head. It is more symmetrical about the shank\nthan the shop head, and there will be less chance of damaging the rivet hole or the material\naround it. To remove rivets, use hand tools, a power drill or a combination of both. The preferred\nmethod is to drill through the rivet head and drive out the remainder of the rivet with a drift punch.\nFirst, le a at area on the head of any round or brazier head rivet, and center punch the at\nsurface for drilling. On thin metal, back up the rivet on the shop head when center punching\nto avoid depressing the metal. The dimple in 2117-T3 rivets usually eliminates the necessity of\nling and center punching the rivet.\n(3)\nSelect a drill one size smaller than the rivet shank and drill out the rivet head. When using a\npower drill, set the drill on the rivet and rotate the chuck several revolutions by hand before\nturning on the power. This procedure helps the drill cut a good starting spot and eliminates the\nchance of the drill slipping off and tracking across the metal. While holding the drill at a 90Â°\nangle, drill the rivet to the depth of its head. Be careful not to drill too deep because the rivet\nshank will turn with the drill and cause a tear. The rivet head will often break away and climb the\ndrill, which is a good signal to withdraw the drill. If the rivet head does not come lose of its own\naccord, insert a drift punch into the hole and twist slightly to either side until the head comes off.\n(4)\nDrive out the shank of the rivet with a drift punch slightly smaller than the diameter of the shank.\nOn thin metal or unsupported structures, support the sheet with a bucking bar while driving out\nthe shank. If the shank is exceptionally tight after the rivet head is removed, drill the rivet about\ntwo-thirds of the way through the thickness of the material and then drive out the remainder of\nthe rivet with a drift punch.\n(5)\nThe removal of ush rivets is the same as that just described except that no ling of the\nmanufactured head is required before center punching. Be very careful to avoid elongation\nof the dimpled or the countersunk holes. The rivet head should be drilled to approximately\none-half the thickness of the top sheet.\nTable 1.

NAS1738M4-4\nrivets may be identied as AIA/NAS1738M4-4.\nC.\nInstallation of Solid Shank Rivets.\n(1)\nA large percentage of riveting of airplane structure is accomplished on thin gauge aluminum alloy,\nand the work must be accomplished without distorting or damaging the material with hammer\nblows or riveting tools. All airplane power riveting is accomplished by upsetting the rivets against\na bucking bar instead of striking the shank with a hammer. To prevent deforming the rivet head,\na rivet set must be selected to t each type of rivet. The depth of this set must not touch material\nbeing riveted. Parts requiring heat treatment should be heat treated before riveting, since heat\ntreating process after rivet installation causes warping. Assemblies that require heat treatment\nin a salt bath must be treated prior to assembly, as the salt cannot be entirely washed out of the\njoints.\n(2)\nThe use of hollow rivets in joining highly stressed parts is not permitted. To determine if blind\nrivets may be substituted, refer to Tables 1 and 2. Selection of the proper rivet and the proper\nnumber of rivets is very important. Rivets must be of the proper length for the total thickness of\nthe parts being riveted. Ordinarily, from 1-1/2 to 2 times the diameter of the rivet is the correct\namount for the rivet shank to protrude through the material to form the head. For heavy material,\nsuch as plates or ttings, from 2 to 2-1/2 times the rivet diameter may be used. The rivet should\nnot be excessively loose in the hole, as this condition will cause the rivet to bend over while\nbeing driven, and the shank will not be sufciently expanded to completely ll the hole. A drill\nfrom 0.002 inch to 0.004 inch larger than the rivet shank should be used for sheet and plate\nriveting. Parts should be held rmly together by clamps, screws, or bolts while they are being\ndrilled or riveted. The bucking bar is to be held against the end of the rivet shank. Exercise care\nwhile accomplishing this operation to prevent unseating the rivet by too much pressure. For the\nrst few blows, the bucking bar should be held lightly against the rivet shank so it will receive\nthe impact of the blow through the rivet. The bucking bar must be held square with the rivet\nto produce uniform upsets. As few blows as possible should be struck to properly upset rivet.\nBlows must be as uniform as possible.\nD.\nLoose Or Working Solid Shank Rivets.\n(1)\nRivets which appear to be loose shall be checked with a 0.002 inch feeler gauge by inserting the\ngauge around the head of the rivet in question. If the feeler gauge can be inserted to the shank\nof the rivet, it shall be classied as a loose rivet and it shall be replaced. If the feeler gauge can\nbe inserted approximately halfway to the shank for less than 30 percent of the circumference\nof the rivet head, it shall not be classied as a loose rivet. The feeler gauge shall be used to\ncheck the shear section between the riveted members (such as skin to spar or different sections\nof skins) in a similar manner to that used around the rivet head. If the skin around the brazier\nhead or countersunk rivet can be moved by depressing the skin with nger pressure around the\nrivet, the rivet shall be replaced. If a rivet is found which turns by applying a rotating load to the\nhead of the rivet, it should be replaced.\n(2)\nIn areas where exterior paint has been applied to rivet heads, the paint may harden due to aging\nprocesses and show hairline cracks around the edge of the rivet heads. This should not be\nused as a basis for determining whether or not the rivet is loose. The hardened paint may crack\nat times and collect dirt or exhaust fumes which will appear as discoloration. It is not possible\nto detect loose rivets visually. Replacement rivets should be of like size and type. In some\ninstances, however, it will be necessary to use the next size larger diameter. For general repair\npractices, the spacing between the centerlines of adjacent rivet holes shall be four diameters or\ngreater. In some areas where the spacing between rivets prohibits the use of the next larger\nrivets, special repair instructions and procedures shall be followed.\nContact Cessna Single\nEngine Support."

        "answer": "WARNING: Operating the fuselage skin without confirming aircraft model can result in loss of control. Carefully evacuate personnel, and consult section 05-20-00 of the maintenance manual for proper panel replacement steps.\n\n6.\nRivet Lengths\nA.\nProper length of rivets is an important part of a repair. Should too long a rivet be used, the formed\nhead will be too large, or the rivet may bend or be forced between the sheets being riveted. Should\ntoo short a rivet be used, the formed head will be too small or the riveted material will be damaged.\nIf proper length rivets are not available, longer rivets may be cut off to equal the proper length (not\ngrip). Rivet length is based on the grip."

        "answer": "NOTE: This procedure applies specifically to aircraft models with engine nacelle configurations post-2015. For older models, refer to AMM revision 22B or later. Always verify tool availability before beginning.\n\n11.\nRivets for Plastic or Composite Parts\nA.\nUnlike rivets in metallic joints, blind rivets are often the rivet of choice for riveting non-metallic materials\nbecause they may be installed without the hammering necessary to install solid rivets. If the tail end\nof the rivet is adjacent to the non-metal side, install a washer over the shank to prevent the \"hole\nlling\" action built into blind rivets from overloading the non-metal hole. The hole in the washer should\nmatch the specied installation hole for the fastener. If the tail end of the rivet is installed through\nmetal substructure, the washer is not necessary.\nB.\nSoft (\"A\" 1100 aluminum shank rivets or \"B\" 5056 aluminum shank) rivets are also used to install non-\nmetallic parts. Original equipment soft rivets will be either red or green colored under the paint. If the\nbutt or driven end of the rivet is adjacent to the non-metallic part, it is preferable to install a washer over\nthe shank to prevent the rivet shank, which swells during driving, from overloading the non-metallic\nhole. The hole in the washer should match the specied installation hole for the fastener. If the tail\nend of the rivet is installed through metal substructure, the washer is not necessary. Take care when\ndriving rivets through non-metal to not overdrive the rivet. If the rivet is overdriven, the shank will swell\neven with the washer in place. The rivet butt should be driven to no more than necessary to retain\nthe part, never more than 1.4 times the shank diameter.\nC.\nIf the original equipment rivet provided connection between metal parts as well as non-metallic parts,\nit may be a standard (AD) rivet. Original equipment AD rivets are colored gold or uncolored. Replace\noriginal equipment AD rivets with AD rivets.\n"

        "question": "What is the significance of the rivet diameter in determining the minimum edge distance and spacing between rivets in a riveted structure, and how does it impact the overall design and integrity of the structure?",
        "answer": "NOTE: If the engine nacelle shows any signs of cracks, do not proceed with the panel replacement until proper inspection and corrective action have been taken.\n\n9.\nSpacing Of Rivets\nA.\nThere are no specic rules which are applicable to every case or type of riveting. There are, however,\ncertain general rules which should be understood and followed. Edge distance of rivets should not\nbe less than two diameters of the rivet, measured from the edge of the sheet or plate to the center of\nthe rivet hole. Spacing between rivets, when in rows, depends upon several factors, principally the\nthickness of the sheet, the diameter of the rivets, and the manner in which the sheet will be stressed.\nThis spacing is seldom less than four diameters of the rivet, measured between the centers of the rivet\nholes. Rivets, spaced four diameters apart, are found in certain seams of semimonocoque fuselages,\nwebs or built up spars, and various plates or ttings. Where there are two rows of rivets, they are\nusually staggered. The transverse pitch or distance between rows should be slightly less than the\npitch of the rivets, with 75 percent of the rivet pitch being the usual practice. An average spacing or\npitch of rivets in the cover or skin of most structures, except at highly stressed points, will be from 6\nto 12 diameters of the rivet. The best practice in repair is to make pitch of rivets equal to those in the\noriginal structure."

        "answer": "WARNING: ventilate area. Failure to secure all panels before fastener removal may lead to fire hazard. Always inspect the wing root and verify that aircraft model.\n\n4.\nSubstitution Of Rivets\nA.\nWhen adapting the typical repairs shown in this manual to suit actual conditions, it may be necessary\nto use different fasteners than those originally used. This may be due to non-availability of a particular\nfastener, restricted access, or other difculties. When replacing rivets, it is desirable to use rivets\nidentical to the type of rivet removed. Countersunk head rivets are to be replaced by rivets of the\nsame type and degree of countersink. When rivet holes become enlarged, deformed, or otherwise\ndamaged, several options are available.\n(1)\nThe simplest solution is to install a 1/32 inch (0.032 inch) larger size rivet as a replacement. This\nsolution uses the designed repairability of the structure, and is the quickest repair.\n(2)\nRepair rivets are available.\n(a)\nRepair rivets have a shank that is 1/64 inch (0.016 inch) larger diameter than a standard\nrivet but have the same size and shape heads.\n(b)\nNAS1241 repair rivets replace MS20426 rivets if they have the same sufx.\n(c)\nNAS1242 repair rivets replace MS20470 rivets if they have the same sufx.\n(d)\nNAS1738, NAS1939 and some NAS9301 through NAS9311 blind rivets also have oversize\nshanks.\nB.\nReplacement shall not be made with rivets of lower strength material.\nC.\nHi-Shear Rivets.\n(1)\nWhen Hi-Shear rivets are not available, replacement of sizes 3/16 inch or greater rivets shall be\nmade with bolts of equal or greater strength than the rivet being replaced, and with self-locking\nnuts of the same diameter. It is permissible to replace Hi-Shear rivets with Hi-Lok bolts of the\nsame material, diameter and grip length.\nD.\nBlind Rivets.\n(1)\nBlind rivets have higher deection rates in shear than standard solid rivets, are more susceptible\nto fatigue failure and are not as strong as solid rivets in thin sheets. For this reason, it is not\nadvisable to replace any considerable number of solid rivets in a given joint by blind rivets,\nbecause this may result in overstressing the remaining solid rivets. The hollow blind rivet shall\nnot be used. The blind rivet shall be of the same or greater strength than the rivet it replaces. In\ncases of dimpled assemblies (the process of forming the metal around a hole to form a conical\nindentation to receive the tapered head of a ush rivet or a screw), the rivet holes shall be\ndrilled after the sheets are dimpled. When possible, the exposed end of each clipped plug\nshall be coated with epoxy primer. Blind rivets shall not be used in fuel bay areas except in\ncases of absolute necessity, and must be sealed. If blind fasteners other than blind rivets are\nencountered, it is recommended that replacements be made with identical fasteners.\nE.\nFor a list of approved solid shank and Hi-Shear rivet substitutions, refer to Tables 1 and 2."

        "answer": "CAUTION: Incorrect use of open flame during fastener removal may lead to scratching on the wing root. Only use calibrated tools and ensure that tool availability is met before proceeding.\n\n7.\nSolid Shank Rivets\nA.\nRemoval of Solid Shank Rivets (Refer to Figure 1).\n(1)\nWhen it becomes necessary to replace a rivet, extreme care should be taken in its removal so\nthat the rivet hole will retain its original size and replacement with a larger size rivet will not be\nnecessary. If the rivet is not removed properly, the strength of the joint may be weakened and\nthe replacement of rivets made more difcult.\n(2)\nWhen removing a rivet, work on the manufactured head. It is more symmetrical about the shank\nthan the shop head, and there will be less chance of damaging the rivet hole or the material\naround it. To remove rivets, use hand tools, a power drill or a combination of both. The preferred\nmethod is to drill through the rivet head and drive out the remainder of the rivet with a drift punch.\nFirst, le a at area on the head of any round or brazier head rivet, and center punch the at\nsurface for drilling. On thin metal, back up the rivet on the shop head when center punching\nto avoid depressing the metal. The dimple in 2117-T3 rivets usually eliminates the necessity of\nling and center punching the rivet.\n(3)\nSelect a drill one size smaller than the rivet shank and drill out the rivet head. When using a\npower drill, set the drill on the rivet and rotate the chuck several revolutions by hand before\nturning on the power. This procedure helps the drill cut a good starting spot and eliminates the\nchance of the drill slipping off and tracking across the metal. While holding the drill at a 90Â°\nangle, drill the rivet to the depth of its head. Be careful not to drill too deep because the rivet\nshank will turn with the drill and cause a tear. The rivet head will often break away and climb the\ndrill, which is a good signal to withdraw the drill. If the rivet head does not come lose of its own\naccord, insert a drift punch into the hole and twist slightly to either side until the head comes off.\n(4)\nDrive out the shank of the rivet with a drift punch slightly smaller than the diameter of the shank.\nOn thin metal or unsupported structures, support the sheet with a bucking bar while driving out\nthe shank. If the shank is exceptionally tight after the rivet head is removed, drill the rivet about\ntwo-thirds of the way through the thickness of the material and then drive out the remainder of\nthe rivet with a drift punch.\n(5)\nThe removal of ush rivets is the same as that just described except that no ling of the\nmanufactured head is required before center punching. Be very careful to avoid elongation\nof the dimpled or the countersunk holes. The rivet head should be drilled to approximately\none-half the thickness of the top sheet.\nTable 1.

NAS1738M4-4\nrivets may be identied as AIA/NAS1738M4-4.\nC.\nInstallation of Solid Shank Rivets.\n(1)\nA large percentage of riveting of airplane structure is accomplished on thin gauge aluminum alloy,\nand the work must be accomplished without distorting or damaging the material with hammer\nblows or riveting tools. All airplane power riveting is accomplished by upsetting the rivets against\na bucking bar instead of striking the shank with a hammer. To prevent deforming the rivet head,\na rivet set must be selected to t each type of rivet. The depth of this set must not touch material\nbeing riveted. Parts requiring heat treatment should be heat treated before riveting, since heat\ntreating process after rivet installation causes warping. Assemblies that require heat treatment\nin a salt bath must be treated prior to assembly, as the salt cannot be entirely washed out of the\njoints.\n(2)\nThe use of hollow rivets in joining highly stressed parts is not permitted. To determine if blind\nrivets may be substituted, refer to Tables 1 and 2. Selection of the proper rivet and the proper\nnumber of rivets is very important. Rivets must be of the proper length for the total thickness of\nthe parts being riveted. Ordinarily, from 1-1/2 to 2 times the diameter of the rivet is the correct\namount for the rivet shank to protrude through the material to form the head. For heavy material,\nsuch as plates or ttings, from 2 to 2-1/2 times the rivet diameter may be used. The rivet should\nnot be excessively loose in the hole, as this condition will cause the rivet to bend over while\nbeing driven, and the shank will not be sufciently expanded to completely ll the hole. A drill\nfrom 0.002 inch to 0.004 inch larger than the rivet shank should be used for sheet and plate\nriveting. Parts should be held rmly together by clamps, screws, or bolts while they are being\ndrilled or riveted. The bucking bar is to be held against the end of the rivet shank. Exercise care\nwhile accomplishing this operation to prevent unseating the rivet by too much pressure. For the\nrst few blows, the bucking bar should be held lightly against the rivet shank so it will receive\nthe impact of the blow through the rivet. The bucking bar must be held square with the rivet\nto produce uniform upsets. As few blows as possible should be struck to properly upset rivet.\nBlows must be as uniform as possible.\nD.\nLoose Or Working Solid Shank Rivets.\n(1)\nRivets which appear to be loose shall be checked with a 0.002 inch feeler gauge by inserting the\ngauge around the head of the rivet in question. If the feeler gauge can be inserted to the shank\nof the rivet, it shall be classied as a loose rivet and it shall be replaced. If the feeler gauge can\nbe inserted approximately halfway to the shank for less than 30 percent of the circumference\nof the rivet head, it shall not be classied as a loose rivet. The feeler gauge shall be used to\ncheck the shear section between the riveted members (such as skin to spar or different sections\nof skins) in a similar manner to that used around the rivet head. If the skin around the brazier\nhead or countersunk rivet can be moved by depressing the skin with nger pressure around the\nrivet, the rivet shall be replaced. If a rivet is found which turns by applying a rotating load to the\nhead of the rivet, it should be replaced.\n(2)\nIn areas where exterior paint has been applied to rivet heads, the paint may harden due to aging\nprocesses and show hairline cracks around the edge of the rivet heads. This should not be\nused as a basis for determining whether or not the rivet is loose. The hardened paint may crack\nat times and collect dirt or exhaust fumes which will appear as discoloration. It is not possible\nto detect loose rivets visually. Replacement rivets should be of like size and type. In some\ninstances, however, it will be necessary to use the next size larger diameter. For general repair\npractices, the spacing between the centerlines of adjacent rivet holes shall be four diameters or\ngreater. In some areas where the spacing between rivets prohibits the use of the next larger\nrivets, special repair instructions and procedures shall be followed.\nContact Cessna Single\nEngine Support."

The rivet will pull down the\nsheet as the stem is pulled if the BK dimension is met or exceeded.\n(8)\nThe minimum blind clearance is the BK dimension, and is listed in the manufacturers standard\nsheets.\nNOTE:\nWhen installing a blind rivet (pull-type rivet) in a hole where the previous blind rivet\nwas removed by drilling and punching the rivet out, inspect the drilled hole to assure\nall metal sheets are in place and not separated prior to pulling rivet.\nIt may be\nnecessary to insert a stiff wire in adjacent hole to hold metal in position while pulling\nrivet.\n(9)\nWhen placing pulling head on rivet stem, hold riveter and pulling head in line with axis of rivet\nwhile holding tool in a light and exible manner.\n(10) When tool is actuated, pulling head will pull down and seat against rivet head.\n(11) Clamping action will pull sheets together and seat rivet when tool is actuated.\n(12) When tool is actuated, action of rivet will automatically assist in bringing tool and pulling head\ninto proper alignment with rivet axis.\nNOTE:\nPressing down with force will not allow rivet and tool to align themselves with hole\nand could limit head setting of rivet, however, enough force to seat the head against\nthe skin is necessary.\n(13) Hold tool in line with rivet as accurately as possible, and allow a steady but light pressure; pull\ntrigger and let the rivet align itself.\n(14) When rivet is completely installed, release trigger and pulling head will eject pulling portion of\nstem through forward end.\n(15) Rivet must break within these limits.\nFastener\nDash number\nStem Flushness\nNAS1738 or NAS1739\nAll\n+0.010 or -0.020 inch\nCherry Max\n-4\n+0.010 or -0.015 inch\nCherry Max\n-5, -6\n+0.010 or -0.020 inch\n(16) Protruding stems usually indicate incorrect grip length or oversize holes.\nD.\nLoose or Working Blind Rivets.\n(1)\nBlind rivets which are found to be loose or show evidence of working must be replaced with\nrivets of like size and type. In some instances, it may be necessary to use the next larger size\nrivet. Loose fasteners may be indicated by the following situation:\n(a)\nThe fastened material moves relative to the fastener. Skin deection is evident.\n(b)\nTipping of the fastener head may indicate its looseness or slippage. Rivet head periphery\nrolled upward also indicates looseness.\n(c)\nA black or dark gray stain is found adjacent to or around the fastener head. Generally, it\ntakes the form of a dirt or oily streak aft of the loose rivet.\n(d)\nMark a red line across the fastener head and the adjacent material. Check the line at the\nnext inspection. Any loosening of the fastener will break the line as indicated in Figure 3."

Always verify tool availability before beginning.\n\n11.\nRivets for Plastic or Composite Parts\nA.\nUnlike rivets in metallic joints, blind rivets are often the rivet of choice for riveting non-metallic materials\nbecause they may be installed without the hammering necessary to install solid rivets. If the tail end\nof the rivet is adjacent to the non-metal side, install a washer over the shank to prevent the \"hole\nlling\" action built into blind rivets from overloading the non-metal hole. The hole in the washer should\nmatch the specied installation hole for the fastener. If the tail end of the rivet is installed through\nmetal substructure, the washer is not necessary.\nB.\nSoft (\"A\" 1100 aluminum shank rivets or \"B\" 5056 aluminum shank) rivets are also used to install non-\nmetallic parts. Original equipment soft rivets will be either red or green colored under the paint. If the\nbutt or driven end of the rivet is adjacent to the non-metallic part, it is preferable to install a washer over\nthe shank to prevent the rivet shank, which swells during driving, from overloading the non-metallic\nhole. The hole in the washer should match the specied installation hole for the fastener. If the tail\nend of the rivet is installed through metal substructure, the washer is not necessary. Take care when\ndriving rivets through non-metal to not overdrive the rivet. If the rivet is overdriven, the shank will swell\neven with the washer in place. The rivet butt should be driven to no more than necessary to retain\nthe part, never more than 1.4 times the shank diameter.\nC.\nIf the original equipment rivet provided connection between metal parts as well as non-metallic parts,\nit may be a standard (AD) rivet. Original equipment AD rivets are colored gold or uncolored. Replace\noriginal equipment AD rivets with AD rivets.\n"

        "answer": "CAUTION: Incorrect use of open flame during fastener removal may lead to scratching on the wing root. Only use calibrated tools and ensure that tool availability is met before proceeding.\n\n7.\nSolid Shank Rivets\nA.\nRemoval of Solid Shank Rivets (Refer to Figure 1).\n(1)\nWhen it becomes necessary to replace a rivet, extreme care should be taken in its removal so\nthat the rivet hole will retain its original size and replacement with a larger size rivet will not be\nnecessary. If the rivet is not removed properly, the strength of the joint may be weakened and\nthe replacement of rivets made more difcult.\n(2)\nWhen removing a rivet, work on the manufactured head. It is more symmetrical about the shank\nthan the shop head, and there will be less chance of damaging the rivet hole or the material\naround it. To remove rivets, use hand tools, a power drill or a combination of both. The preferred\nmethod is to drill through the rivet head and drive out the remainder of the rivet with a drift punch.\nFirst, le a at area on the head of any round or brazier head rivet, and center punch the at\nsurface for drilling. On thin metal, back up the rivet on the shop head when center punching\nto avoid depressing the metal. The dimple in 2117-T3 rivets usually eliminates the necessity of\nling and center punching the rivet.\n(3)\nSelect a drill one size smaller than the rivet shank and drill out the rivet head. When using a\npower drill, set the drill on the rivet and rotate the chuck several revolutions by hand before\nturning on the power. This procedure helps the drill cut a good starting spot and eliminates the\nchance of the drill slipping off and tracking across the metal. While holding the drill at a 90Â°\nangle, drill the rivet to the depth of its head. Be careful not to drill too deep because the rivet\nshank will turn with the drill and cause a tear. The rivet head will often break away and climb the\ndrill, which is a good signal to withdraw the drill. If the rivet head does not come lose of its own\naccord, insert a drift punch into the hole and twist slightly to either side until the head comes off.\n(4)\nDrive out the shank of the rivet with a drift punch slightly smaller than the diameter of the shank.\nOn thin metal or unsupported structures, support the sheet with a bucking bar while driving out\nthe shank. If the shank is exceptionally tight after the rivet head is removed, drill the rivet about\ntwo-thirds of the way through the thickness of the material and then drive out the remainder of\nthe rivet with a drift punch.\n(5)\nThe removal of ush rivets is the same as that just described except that no ling of the\nmanufactured head is required before center punching. Be very careful to avoid elongation\nof the dimpled or the countersunk holes. The rivet head should be drilled to approximately\none-half the thickness of the top sheet.\nTable 1.

NAS1738M4-4\nrivets may be identied as AIA/NAS1738M4-4.\nC.\nInstallation of Solid Shank Rivets.\n(1)\nA large percentage of riveting of airplane structure is accomplished on thin gauge aluminum alloy,\nand the work must be accomplished without distorting or damaging the material with hammer\nblows or riveting tools. All airplane power riveting is accomplished by upsetting the rivets against\na bucking bar instead of striking the shank with a hammer. To prevent deforming the rivet head,\na rivet set must be selected to t each type of rivet. The depth of this set must not touch material\nbeing riveted. Parts requiring heat treatment should be heat treated before riveting, since heat\ntreating process after rivet installation causes warping. Assemblies that require heat treatment\nin a salt bath must be treated prior to assembly, as the salt cannot be entirely washed out of the\njoints.\n(2)\nThe use of hollow rivets in joining highly stressed parts is not permitted. To determine if blind\nrivets may be substituted, refer to Tables 1 and 2. Selection of the proper rivet and the proper\nnumber of rivets is very important. Rivets must be of the proper length for the total thickness of\nthe parts being riveted. Ordinarily, from 1-1/2 to 2 times the diameter of the rivet is the correct\namount for the rivet shank to protrude through the material to form the head. For heavy material,\nsuch as plates or ttings, from 2 to 2-1/2 times the rivet diameter may be used. The rivet should\nnot be excessively loose in the hole, as this condition will cause the rivet to bend over while\nbeing driven, and the shank will not be sufciently expanded to completely ll the hole. A drill\nfrom 0.002 inch to 0.004 inch larger than the rivet shank should be used for sheet and plate\nriveting. Parts should be held rmly together by clamps, screws, or bolts while they are being\ndrilled or riveted. The bucking bar is to be held against the end of the rivet shank. Exercise care\nwhile accomplishing this operation to prevent unseating the rivet by too much pressure. For the\nrst few blows, the bucking bar should be held lightly against the rivet shank so it will receive\nthe impact of the blow through the rivet. The bucking bar must be held square with the rivet\nto produce uniform upsets. As few blows as possible should be struck to properly upset rivet.\nBlows must be as uniform as possible.\nD.\nLoose Or Working Solid Shank Rivets.\n(1)\nRivets which appear to be loose shall be checked with a 0.002 inch feeler gauge by inserting the\ngauge around the head of the rivet in question. If the feeler gauge can be inserted to the shank\nof the rivet, it shall be classied as a loose rivet and it shall be replaced. If the feeler gauge can\nbe inserted approximately halfway to the shank for less than 30 percent of the circumference\nof the rivet head, it shall not be classied as a loose rivet. The feeler gauge shall be used to\ncheck the shear section between the riveted members (such as skin to spar or different sections\nof skins) in a similar manner to that used around the rivet head. If the skin around the brazier\nhead or countersunk rivet can be moved by depressing the skin with nger pressure around the\nrivet, the rivet shall be replaced. If a rivet is found which turns by applying a rotating load to the\nhead of the rivet, it should be replaced.\n(2)\nIn areas where exterior paint has been applied to rivet heads, the paint may harden due to aging\nprocesses and show hairline cracks around the edge of the rivet heads. This should not be\nused as a basis for determining whether or not the rivet is loose. The hardened paint may crack\nat times and collect dirt or exhaust fumes which will appear as discoloration. It is not possible\nto detect loose rivets visually. Replacement rivets should be of like size and type. In some\ninstances, however, it will be necessary to use the next size larger diameter. For general repair\npractices, the spacing between the centerlines of adjacent rivet holes shall be four diameters or\ngreater. In some areas where the spacing between rivets prohibits the use of the next larger\nrivets, special repair instructions and procedures shall be followed.\nContact Cessna Single\nEngine Support."

        "question": "What is the significance of maintaining a specific edge distance of rivets from the edge of a sheet or plate, and how does it impact the overall structure?",
        "answer": "NOTE: If the engine nacelle shows any signs of cracks, do not proceed with the panel replacement until proper inspection and corrective action have been taken.\n\n9.\nSpacing Of Rivets\nA.\nThere are no specic rules which are applicable to every case or type of riveting. There are, however,\ncertain general rules which should be understood and followed. Edge distance of rivets should not\nbe less than two diameters of the rivet, measured from the edge of the sheet or plate to the center of\nthe rivet hole. Spacing between rivets, when in rows, depends upon several factors, principally the\nthickness of the sheet, the diameter of the rivets, and the manner in which the sheet will be stressed.\nThis spacing is seldom less than four diameters of the rivet, measured between the centers of the rivet\nholes. Rivets, spaced four diameters apart, are found in certain seams of semimonocoque fuselages,\nwebs or built up spars, and various plates or ttings. Where there are two rows of rivets, they are\nusually staggered. The transverse pitch or distance between rows should be slightly less than the\npitch of the rivets, with 75 percent of the rivet pitch being the usual practice. An average spacing or\npitch of rivets in the cover or skin of most structures, except at highly stressed points, will be from 6\nto 12 diameters of the rivet. The best practice in repair is to make pitch of rivets equal to those in the\noriginal structure."

Always inspect the wing root and verify that aircraft model.\n\n4.\nSubstitution Of Rivets\nA.\nWhen adapting the typical repairs shown in this manual to suit actual conditions, it may be necessary\nto use different fasteners than those originally used. This may be due to non-availability of a particular\nfastener, restricted access, or other difculties. When replacing rivets, it is desirable to use rivets\nidentical to the type of rivet removed. Countersunk head rivets are to be replaced by rivets of the\nsame type and degree of countersink. When rivet holes become enlarged, deformed, or otherwise\ndamaged, several options are available.\n(1)\nThe simplest solution is to install a 1/32 inch (0.032 inch) larger size rivet as a replacement. This\nsolution uses the designed repairability of the structure, and is the quickest repair.\n(2)\nRepair rivets are available.\n(a)\nRepair rivets have a shank that is 1/64 inch (0.016 inch) larger diameter than a standard\nrivet but have the same size and shape heads.\n(b)\nNAS1241 repair rivets replace MS20426 rivets if they have the same sufx.\n(c)\nNAS1242 repair rivets replace MS20470 rivets if they have the same sufx.\n(d)\nNAS1738, NAS1939 and some NAS9301 through NAS9311 blind rivets also have oversize\nshanks.\nB.\nReplacement shall not be made with rivets of lower strength material.\nC.\nHi-Shear Rivets.\n(1)\nWhen Hi-Shear rivets are not available, replacement of sizes 3/16 inch or greater rivets shall be\nmade with bolts of equal or greater strength than the rivet being replaced, and with self-locking\nnuts of the same diameter. It is permissible to replace Hi-Shear rivets with Hi-Lok bolts of the\nsame material, diameter and grip length.\nD.\nBlind Rivets.\n(1)\nBlind rivets have higher deection rates in shear than standard solid rivets, are more susceptible\nto fatigue failure and are not as strong as solid rivets in thin sheets. For this reason, it is not\nadvisable to replace any considerable number of solid rivets in a given joint by blind rivets,\nbecause this may result in overstressing the remaining solid rivets. The hollow blind rivet shall\nnot be used. The blind rivet shall be of the same or greater strength than the rivet it replaces. In\ncases of dimpled assemblies (the process of forming the metal around a hole to form a conical\nindentation to receive the tapered head of a ush rivet or a screw), the rivet holes shall be\ndrilled after the sheets are dimpled. When possible, the exposed end of each clipped plug\nshall be coated with epoxy primer. Blind rivets shall not be used in fuel bay areas except in\ncases of absolute necessity, and must be sealed. If blind fasteners other than blind rivets are\nencountered, it is recommended that replacements be made with identical fasteners.\nE.\nFor a list of approved solid shank and Hi-Shear rivet substitutions, refer to Tables 1 and 2."

Always verify tool availability before beginning.\n\n11.\nRivets for Plastic or Composite Parts\nA.\nUnlike rivets in metallic joints, blind rivets are often the rivet of choice for riveting non-metallic materials\nbecause they may be installed without the hammering necessary to install solid rivets. If the tail end\nof the rivet is adjacent to the non-metal side, install a washer over the shank to prevent the \"hole\nlling\" action built into blind rivets from overloading the non-metal hole. The hole in the washer should\nmatch the specied installation hole for the fastener. If the tail end of the rivet is installed through\nmetal substructure, the washer is not necessary.\nB.\nSoft (\"A\" 1100 aluminum shank rivets or \"B\" 5056 aluminum shank) rivets are also used to install non-\nmetallic parts. Original equipment soft rivets will be either red or green colored under the paint. If the\nbutt or driven end of the rivet is adjacent to the non-metallic part, it is preferable to install a washer over\nthe shank to prevent the rivet shank, which swells during driving, from overloading the non-metallic\nhole. The hole in the washer should match the specied installation hole for the fastener. If the tail\nend of the rivet is installed through metal substructure, the washer is not necessary. Take care when\ndriving rivets through non-metal to not overdrive the rivet. If the rivet is overdriven, the shank will swell\neven with the washer in place. The rivet butt should be driven to no more than necessary to retain\nthe part, never more than 1.4 times the shank diameter.\nC.\nIf the original equipment rivet provided connection between metal parts as well as non-metallic parts,\nit may be a standard (AD) rivet.

The preferred\nmethod is to drill through the rivet head and drive out the remainder of the rivet with a drift punch.\nFirst, le a at area on the head of any round or brazier head rivet, and center punch the at\nsurface for drilling. On thin metal, back up the rivet on the shop head when center punching\nto avoid depressing the metal. The dimple in 2117-T3 rivets usually eliminates the necessity of\nling and center punching the rivet.\n(3)\nSelect a drill one size smaller than the rivet shank and drill out the rivet head. When using a\npower drill, set the drill on the rivet and rotate the chuck several revolutions by hand before\nturning on the power. This procedure helps the drill cut a good starting spot and eliminates the\nchance of the drill slipping off and tracking across the metal. While holding the drill at a 90Â°\nangle, drill the rivet to the depth of its head. Be careful not to drill too deep because the rivet\nshank will turn with the drill and cause a tear. The rivet head will often break away and climb the\ndrill, which is a good signal to withdraw the drill. If the rivet head does not come lose of its own\naccord, insert a drift punch into the hole and twist slightly to either side until the head comes off.\n(4)\nDrive out the shank of the rivet with a drift punch slightly smaller than the diameter of the shank.\nOn thin metal or unsupported structures, support the sheet with a bucking bar while driving out\nthe shank. If the shank is exceptionally tight after the rivet head is removed, drill the rivet about\ntwo-thirds of the way through the thickness of the material and then drive out the remainder of\nthe rivet with a drift punch.\n(5)\nThe removal of ush rivets is the same as that just described except that no ling of the\nmanufactured head is required before center punching. Be very careful to avoid elongation\nof the dimpled or the countersunk holes. The rivet head should be drilled to approximately\none-half the thickness of the top sheet.\nTable 1.

NAS1738M4-4\nrivets may be identied as AIA/NAS1738M4-4.\nC.\nInstallation of Solid Shank Rivets.\n(1)\nA large percentage of riveting of airplane structure is accomplished on thin gauge aluminum alloy,\nand the work must be accomplished without distorting or damaging the material with hammer\nblows or riveting tools. All airplane power riveting is accomplished by upsetting the rivets against\na bucking bar instead of striking the shank with a hammer. To prevent deforming the rivet head,\na rivet set must be selected to t each type of rivet. The depth of this set must not touch material\nbeing riveted. Parts requiring heat treatment should be heat treated before riveting, since heat\ntreating process after rivet installation causes warping. Assemblies that require heat treatment\nin a salt bath must be treated prior to assembly, as the salt cannot be entirely washed out of the\njoints.\n(2)\nThe use of hollow rivets in joining highly stressed parts is not permitted. To determine if blind\nrivets may be substituted, refer to Tables 1 and 2. Selection of the proper rivet and the proper\nnumber of rivets is very important. Rivets must be of the proper length for the total thickness of\nthe parts being riveted. Ordinarily, from 1-1/2 to 2 times the diameter of the rivet is the correct\namount for the rivet shank to protrude through the material to form the head. For heavy material,\nsuch as plates or ttings, from 2 to 2-1/2 times the rivet diameter may be used. The rivet should\nnot be excessively loose in the hole, as this condition will cause the rivet to bend over while\nbeing driven, and the shank will not be sufciently expanded to completely ll the hole. A drill\nfrom 0.002 inch to 0.004 inch larger than the rivet shank should be used for sheet and plate\nriveting. Parts should be held rmly together by clamps, screws, or bolts while they are being\ndrilled or riveted. The bucking bar is to be held against the end of the rivet shank. Exercise care\nwhile accomplishing this operation to prevent unseating the rivet by too much pressure. For the\nrst few blows, the bucking bar should be held lightly against the rivet shank so it will receive\nthe impact of the blow through the rivet. The bucking bar must be held square with the rivet\nto produce uniform upsets. As few blows as possible should be struck to properly upset rivet.\nBlows must be as uniform as possible.\nD.\nLoose Or Working Solid Shank Rivets.\n(1)\nRivets which appear to be loose shall be checked with a 0.002 inch feeler gauge by inserting the\ngauge around the head of the rivet in question. If the feeler gauge can be inserted to the shank\nof the rivet, it shall be classied as a loose rivet and it shall be replaced. If the feeler gauge can\nbe inserted approximately halfway to the shank for less than 30 percent of the circumference\nof the rivet head, it shall not be classied as a loose rivet. The feeler gauge shall be used to\ncheck the shear section between the riveted members (such as skin to spar or different sections\nof skins) in a similar manner to that used around the rivet head. If the skin around the brazier\nhead or countersunk rivet can be moved by depressing the skin with nger pressure around the\nrivet, the rivet shall be replaced. If a rivet is found which turns by applying a rotating load to the\nhead of the rivet, it should be replaced.\n(2)\nIn areas where exterior paint has been applied to rivet heads, the paint may harden due to aging\nprocesses and show hairline cracks around the edge of the rivet heads. This should not be\nused as a basis for determining whether or not the rivet is loose. The hardened paint may crack\nat times and collect dirt or exhaust fumes which will appear as discoloration. It is not possible\nto detect loose rivets visually. Replacement rivets should be of like size and type. In some\ninstances, however, it will be necessary to use the next size larger diameter. For general repair\npractices, the spacing between the centerlines of adjacent rivet holes shall be four diameters or\ngreater. In some areas where the spacing between rivets prohibits the use of the next larger\nrivets, special repair instructions and procedures shall be followed.\nContact Cessna Single\nEngine Support."

        "answer": "CAUTION: Incorrect use of solvent cleaners during panel replacement may lead to scratching on the wing root. Only use protective materials and ensure that ambient temperature is met before proceeding.\n\n10.\nThreaded Fasteners Bolt Torques\nA.\nThe importance of correct application cannot be overemphasized. Refer to appropriate Maintenance\nManual, Chapter 20, Torque Data - Maintenance Practices, for additional information covering torque\nvalues. Under torque can result in unnecessary wear of nuts and bolts as well as parts they are\nholding together. When insufcient pressures are applied, uneven loads will be transmitted throughout\nassembly, which may result in excessive wear or premature failure due to fatigue. Over torque can\nbe equally damaging because of failure of a bolt or nut from overstressing threaded areas. There are\na few simple, but very important, procedures that should be followed to assure that correct torque is\napplied:\n(1)\nCalibrate torque wrench periodically to assure accuracy, and recheck frequently.\n(2)\nBe sure that bolt and nut threads are clean and dry unless otherwise specied.\n(3)\nRun nut down to near contact with washer or bearing surface and check friction drag torque\nrequired to turn nut.\n(4)\nAdd friction drag torque to desired torque recommended. Refer to appropriate Maintenance\nManual, Chapter 20, Torque Data - Maintenance Practices to obtain complete torque calculating\nprocedures. This is referred to as nal torque which should register on indicator or setting for a\nsnap over-type wrench.\n(5)\nApply a smooth even pull when applying torque pressure. If chattering or a jerking motion occurs\nduring nal torque, back off and re-torque.\n(6)\nWhen installing a castellated nut, start alignment with cotter pin hole at minimum recommended\ntorque plus friction drag torque, and do not exceed maximum torque plus friction drag. If hole\nand nut castellation do not align, change washers or nut and try again. Exceeding maximum\nrecommended torque is not recommended unless specically allowed or recommended for that\nparticular installation."

Flathead rivets are generally used in the airplane interior, where head clearance is required.\nMS20426 countersunk head rivets are used on the exterior surfaces of the airplane to minimize\nturbulent airow. MS20470 universal head rivets are used on the exterior surfaces of the airplane\nwhere strength requirements necessitate a stronger rivet head than that of the countersunk head\nrivet. Hi-Shear rivets are special, patented rivets having a high shear strength equivalent to that of\nstandard NAS bolts. They are used in special cases in locations where high shear loads are present,\nsuch as in spars, wings, and in heavy bulkhead ribs. This rivet consists of a cadmium plated pin of\nalloy steel. Some have a collar of aluminum alloy. Some of these rivets can be readily identied by\nthe presence of the attached collar in place of the formed head on standard rivets. Blind rivets are\nused, where strength requirements permit, where one side of the structure is inaccessible, making it\nimpossible or impractical to drive standard solid shank rivets."

Always inspect the wing root and verify that aircraft model.\n\n4.\nSubstitution Of Rivets\nA.\nWhen adapting the typical repairs shown in this manual to suit actual conditions, it may be necessary\nto use different fasteners than those originally used. This may be due to non-availability of a particular\nfastener, restricted access, or other difculties. When replacing rivets, it is desirable to use rivets\nidentical to the type of rivet removed. Countersunk head rivets are to be replaced by rivets of the\nsame type and degree of countersink. When rivet holes become enlarged, deformed, or otherwise\ndamaged, several options are available.\n(1)\nThe simplest solution is to install a 1/32 inch (0.032 inch) larger size rivet as a replacement.

It is permissible to replace Hi-Shear rivets with Hi-Lok bolts of the\nsame material, diameter and grip length.\nD.\nBlind Rivets.\n(1)\nBlind rivets have higher deection rates in shear than standard solid rivets, are more susceptible\nto fatigue failure and are not as strong as solid rivets in thin sheets. For this reason, it is not\nadvisable to replace any considerable number of solid rivets in a given joint by blind rivets,\nbecause this may result in overstressing the remaining solid rivets. The hollow blind rivet shall\nnot be used. The blind rivet shall be of the same or greater strength than the rivet it replaces. In\ncases of dimpled assemblies (the process of forming the metal around a hole to form a conical\nindentation to receive the tapered head of a ush rivet or a screw), the rivet holes shall be\ndrilled after the sheets are dimpled. When possible, the exposed end of each clipped plug\nshall be coated with epoxy primer. Blind rivets shall not be used in fuel bay areas except in\ncases of absolute necessity, and must be sealed. If blind fasteners other than blind rivets are\nencountered, it is recommended that replacements be made with identical fasteners.\nE.\nFor a list of approved solid shank and Hi-Shear rivet substitutions, refer to Tables 1 and 2."

        "answer": "NOTE: If the engine nacelle shows any signs of cracks, do not proceed with the panel replacement until proper inspection and corrective action have been taken.\n\n9.\nSpacing Of Rivets\nA.\nThere are no specic rules which are applicable to every case or type of riveting. There are, however,\ncertain general rules which should be understood and followed. Edge distance of rivets should not\nbe less than two diameters of the rivet, measured from the edge of the sheet or plate to the center of\nthe rivet hole. Spacing between rivets, when in rows, depends upon several factors, principally the\nthickness of the sheet, the diameter of the rivets, and the manner in which the sheet will be stressed.\nThis spacing is seldom less than four diameters of the rivet, measured between the centers of the rivet\nholes. Rivets, spaced four diameters apart, are found in certain seams of semimonocoque fuselages,\nwebs or built up spars, and various plates or ttings. Where there are two rows of rivets, they are\nusually staggered. The transverse pitch or distance between rows should be slightly less than the\npitch of the rivets, with 75 percent of the rivet pitch being the usual practice. An average spacing or\npitch of rivets in the cover or skin of most structures, except at highly stressed points, will be from 6\nto 12 diameters of the rivet. The best practice in repair is to make pitch of rivets equal to those in the\noriginal structure."

        "question": "What is the significance of the specified installation hole for the fastener in relation to the hole in the washer when installing rivets for non-metallic parts, and why is it important to ensure they match?",
        "answer": "NOTE: This procedure applies specifically to aircraft models with engine nacelle configurations post-2015. For older models, refer to AMM revision 22B or later. Always verify tool availability before beginning.\n\n11.\nRivets for Plastic or Composite Parts\nA.\nUnlike rivets in metallic joints, blind rivets are often the rivet of choice for riveting non-metallic materials\nbecause they may be installed without the hammering necessary to install solid rivets. If the tail end\nof the rivet is adjacent to the non-metal side, install a washer over the shank to prevent the \"hole\nlling\" action built into blind rivets from overloading the non-metal hole. The hole in the washer should\nmatch the specied installation hole for the fastener. If the tail end of the rivet is installed through\nmetal substructure, the washer is not necessary.\nB.\nSoft (\"A\" 1100 aluminum shank rivets or \"B\" 5056 aluminum shank) rivets are also used to install non-\nmetallic parts. Original equipment soft rivets will be either red or green colored under the paint. If the\nbutt or driven end of the rivet is adjacent to the non-metallic part, it is preferable to install a washer over\nthe shank to prevent the rivet shank, which swells during driving, from overloading the non-metallic\nhole.

Always verify tool availability before beginning.\n\n11.\nRivets for Plastic or Composite Parts\nA.\nUnlike rivets in metallic joints, blind rivets are often the rivet of choice for riveting non-metallic materials\nbecause they may be installed without the hammering necessary to install solid rivets. If the tail end\nof the rivet is adjacent to the non-metal side, install a washer over the shank to prevent the \"hole\nlling\" action built into blind rivets from overloading the non-metal hole.

If the tail end of the rivet is installed through\nmetal substructure, the washer is not necessary.\nB.\nSoft (\"A\" 1100 aluminum shank rivets or \"B\" 5056 aluminum shank) rivets are also used to install non-\nmetallic parts. Original equipment soft rivets will be either red or green colored under the paint. If the\nbutt or driven end of the rivet is adjacent to the non-metallic part, it is preferable to install a washer over\nthe shank to prevent the rivet shank, which swells during driving, from overloading the non-metallic\nhole.

        "question": "What are the specific guidelines for selecting and using a rivet set to prevent deforming the rivet head during the riveting process, and how should the depth of the rivet set be determined to avoid touching the material being riveted?",
        "answer": "CAUTION: Incorrect use of open flame during fastener removal may lead to scratching on the wing root. Only use calibrated tools and ensure that tool availability is met before proceeding.\n\n7.\nSolid Shank Rivets\nA.\nRemoval of Solid Shank Rivets (Refer to Figure 1).\n(1)\nWhen it becomes necessary to replace a rivet, extreme care should be taken in its removal so\nthat the rivet hole will retain its original size and replacement with a larger size rivet will not be\nnecessary. If the rivet is not removed properly, the strength of the joint may be weakened and\nthe replacement of rivets made more difcult.\n(2)\nWhen removing a rivet, work on the manufactured head. It is more symmetrical about the shank\nthan the shop head, and there will be less chance of damaging the rivet hole or the material\naround it. To remove rivets, use hand tools, a power drill or a combination of both. The preferred\nmethod is to drill through the rivet head and drive out the remainder of the rivet with a drift punch.\nFirst, le a at area on the head of any round or brazier head rivet, and center punch the at\nsurface for drilling. On thin metal, back up the rivet on the shop head when center punching\nto avoid depressing the metal. The dimple in 2117-T3 rivets usually eliminates the necessity of\nling and center punching the rivet.\n(3)\nSelect a drill one size smaller than the rivet shank and drill out the rivet head. When using a\npower drill, set the drill on the rivet and rotate the chuck several revolutions by hand before\nturning on the power. This procedure helps the drill cut a good starting spot and eliminates the\nchance of the drill slipping off and tracking across the metal. While holding the drill at a 90Â°\nangle, drill the rivet to the depth of its head. Be careful not to drill too deep because the rivet\nshank will turn with the drill and cause a tear. The rivet head will often break away and climb the\ndrill, which is a good signal to withdraw the drill. If the rivet head does not come lose of its own\naccord, insert a drift punch into the hole and twist slightly to either side until the head comes off.\n(4)\nDrive out the shank of the rivet with a drift punch slightly smaller than the diameter of the shank.\nOn thin metal or unsupported structures, support the sheet with a bucking bar while driving out\nthe shank. If the shank is exceptionally tight after the rivet head is removed, drill the rivet about\ntwo-thirds of the way through the thickness of the material and then drive out the remainder of\nthe rivet with a drift punch.\n(5)\nThe removal of ush rivets is the same as that just described except that no ling of the\nmanufactured head is required before center punching. Be very careful to avoid elongation\nof the dimpled or the countersunk holes. The rivet head should be drilled to approximately\none-half the thickness of the top sheet.\nTable 1.

NAS1738M4-4\nrivets may be identied as AIA/NAS1738M4-4.\nC.\nInstallation of Solid Shank Rivets.\n(1)\nA large percentage of riveting of airplane structure is accomplished on thin gauge aluminum alloy,\nand the work must be accomplished without distorting or damaging the material with hammer\nblows or riveting tools. All airplane power riveting is accomplished by upsetting the rivets against\na bucking bar instead of striking the shank with a hammer. To prevent deforming the rivet head,\na rivet set must be selected to t each type of rivet. The depth of this set must not touch material\nbeing riveted. Parts requiring heat treatment should be heat treated before riveting, since heat\ntreating process after rivet installation causes warping. Assemblies that require heat treatment\nin a salt bath must be treated prior to assembly, as the salt cannot be entirely washed out of the\njoints.\n(2)\nThe use of hollow rivets in joining highly stressed parts is not permitted. To determine if blind\nrivets may be substituted, refer to Tables 1 and 2. Selection of the proper rivet and the proper\nnumber of rivets is very important. Rivets must be of the proper length for the total thickness of\nthe parts being riveted. Ordinarily, from 1-1/2 to 2 times the diameter of the rivet is the correct\namount for the rivet shank to protrude through the material to form the head. For heavy material,\nsuch as plates or ttings, from 2 to 2-1/2 times the rivet diameter may be used. The rivet should\nnot be excessively loose in the hole, as this condition will cause the rivet to bend over while\nbeing driven, and the shank will not be sufciently expanded to completely ll the hole. A drill\nfrom 0.002 inch to 0.004 inch larger than the rivet shank should be used for sheet and plate\nriveting. Parts should be held rmly together by clamps, screws, or bolts while they are being\ndrilled or riveted. The bucking bar is to be held against the end of the rivet shank. Exercise care\nwhile accomplishing this operation to prevent unseating the rivet by too much pressure. For the\nrst few blows, the bucking bar should be held lightly against the rivet shank so it will receive\nthe impact of the blow through the rivet. The bucking bar must be held square with the rivet\nto produce uniform upsets. As few blows as possible should be struck to properly upset rivet.\nBlows must be as uniform as possible.\nD.\nLoose Or Working Solid Shank Rivets.\n(1)\nRivets which appear to be loose shall be checked with a 0.002 inch feeler gauge by inserting the\ngauge around the head of the rivet in question. If the feeler gauge can be inserted to the shank\nof the rivet, it shall be classied as a loose rivet and it shall be replaced. If the feeler gauge can\nbe inserted approximately halfway to the shank for less than 30 percent of the circumference\nof the rivet head, it shall not be classied as a loose rivet. The feeler gauge shall be used to\ncheck the shear section between the riveted members (such as skin to spar or different sections\nof skins) in a similar manner to that used around the rivet head. If the skin around the brazier\nhead or countersunk rivet can be moved by depressing the skin with nger pressure around the\nrivet, the rivet shall be replaced. If a rivet is found which turns by applying a rotating load to the\nhead of the rivet, it should be replaced.\n(2)\nIn areas where exterior paint has been applied to rivet heads, the paint may harden due to aging\nprocesses and show hairline cracks around the edge of the rivet heads. This should not be\nused as a basis for determining whether or not the rivet is loose. The hardened paint may crack\nat times and collect dirt or exhaust fumes which will appear as discoloration. It is not possible\nto detect loose rivets visually. Replacement rivets should be of like size and type. In some\ninstances, however, it will be necessary to use the next size larger diameter. For general repair\npractices, the spacing between the centerlines of adjacent rivet holes shall be four diameters or\ngreater. In some areas where the spacing between rivets prohibits the use of the next larger\nrivets, special repair instructions and procedures shall be followed.\nContact Cessna Single\nEngine Support."

        "answer": "WARNING: ventilate area. Failure to secure all panels before fastener removal may lead to fire hazard. Always inspect the wing root and verify that aircraft model.\n\n4.\nSubstitution Of Rivets\nA.\nWhen adapting the typical repairs shown in this manual to suit actual conditions, it may be necessary\nto use different fasteners than those originally used. This may be due to non-availability of a particular\nfastener, restricted access, or other difculties. When replacing rivets, it is desirable to use rivets\nidentical to the type of rivet removed. Countersunk head rivets are to be replaced by rivets of the\nsame type and degree of countersink. When rivet holes become enlarged, deformed, or otherwise\ndamaged, several options are available.\n(1)\nThe simplest solution is to install a 1/32 inch (0.032 inch) larger size rivet as a replacement. This\nsolution uses the designed repairability of the structure, and is the quickest repair.\n(2)\nRepair rivets are available.\n(a)\nRepair rivets have a shank that is 1/64 inch (0.016 inch) larger diameter than a standard\nrivet but have the same size and shape heads.\n(b)\nNAS1241 repair rivets replace MS20426 rivets if they have the same sufx.\n(c)\nNAS1242 repair rivets replace MS20470 rivets if they have the same sufx.\n(d)\nNAS1738, NAS1939 and some NAS9301 through NAS9311 blind rivets also have oversize\nshanks.\nB.\nReplacement shall not be made with rivets of lower strength material.\nC.\nHi-Shear Rivets.\n(1)\nWhen Hi-Shear rivets are not available, replacement of sizes 3/16 inch or greater rivets shall be\nmade with bolts of equal or greater strength than the rivet being replaced, and with self-locking\nnuts of the same diameter. It is permissible to replace Hi-Shear rivets with Hi-Lok bolts of the\nsame material, diameter and grip length.\nD.\nBlind Rivets.\n(1)\nBlind rivets have higher deection rates in shear than standard solid rivets, are more susceptible\nto fatigue failure and are not as strong as solid rivets in thin sheets. For this reason, it is not\nadvisable to replace any considerable number of solid rivets in a given joint by blind rivets,\nbecause this may result in overstressing the remaining solid rivets. The hollow blind rivet shall\nnot be used. The blind rivet shall be of the same or greater strength than the rivet it replaces. In\ncases of dimpled assemblies (the process of forming the metal around a hole to form a conical\nindentation to receive the tapered head of a ush rivet or a screw), the rivet holes shall be\ndrilled after the sheets are dimpled. When possible, the exposed end of each clipped plug\nshall be coated with epoxy primer. Blind rivets shall not be used in fuel bay areas except in\ncases of absolute necessity, and must be sealed. If blind fasteners other than blind rivets are\nencountered, it is recommended that replacements be made with identical fasteners.\nE.\nFor a list of approved solid shank and Hi-Shear rivet substitutions, refer to Tables 1 and 2."

        "question": "In a riveted structure, how does the practice of staggering rows of rivets impact the overall spacing and arrangement of rivets, particularly in relation to the distance between the centers of the rivet holes?",
        "answer": "NOTE: If the engine nacelle shows any signs of cracks, do not proceed with the panel replacement until proper inspection and corrective action have been taken.\n\n9.\nSpacing Of Rivets\nA.\nThere are no specic rules which are applicable to every case or type of riveting. There are, however,\ncertain general rules which should be understood and followed. Edge distance of rivets should not\nbe less than two diameters of the rivet, measured from the edge of the sheet or plate to the center of\nthe rivet hole. Spacing between rivets, when in rows, depends upon several factors, principally the\nthickness of the sheet, the diameter of the rivets, and the manner in which the sheet will be stressed.\nThis spacing is seldom less than four diameters of the rivet, measured between the centers of the rivet\nholes. Rivets, spaced four diameters apart, are found in certain seams of semimonocoque fuselages,\nwebs or built up spars, and various plates or ttings. Where there are two rows of rivets, they are\nusually staggered. The transverse pitch or distance between rows should be slightly less than the\npitch of the rivets, with 75 percent of the rivet pitch being the usual practice. An average spacing or\npitch of rivets in the cover or skin of most structures, except at highly stressed points, will be from 6\nto 12 diameters of the rivet. The best practice in repair is to make pitch of rivets equal to those in the\noriginal structure."

        "question": "What are the specific considerations and guidelines for preventing warping of the material during the heat treatment process after rivet installation, and how can this be avoided by heat treating parts before riveting?",
        "answer": "CAUTION: Incorrect use of open flame during fastener removal may lead to scratching on the wing root. Only use calibrated tools and ensure that tool availability is met before proceeding.\n\n7.\nSolid Shank Rivets\nA.\nRemoval of Solid Shank Rivets (Refer to Figure 1).\n(1)\nWhen it becomes necessary to replace a rivet, extreme care should be taken in its removal so\nthat the rivet hole will retain its original size and replacement with a larger size rivet will not be\nnecessary. If the rivet is not removed properly, the strength of the joint may be weakened and\nthe replacement of rivets made more difcult.\n(2)\nWhen removing a rivet, work on the manufactured head. It is more symmetrical about the shank\nthan the shop head, and there will be less chance of damaging the rivet hole or the material\naround it. To remove rivets, use hand tools, a power drill or a combination of both. The preferred\nmethod is to drill through the rivet head and drive out the remainder of the rivet with a drift punch.\nFirst, le a at area on the head of any round or brazier head rivet, and center punch the at\nsurface for drilling. On thin metal, back up the rivet on the shop head when center punching\nto avoid depressing the metal. The dimple in 2117-T3 rivets usually eliminates the necessity of\nling and center punching the rivet.\n(3)\nSelect a drill one size smaller than the rivet shank and drill out the rivet head. When using a\npower drill, set the drill on the rivet and rotate the chuck several revolutions by hand before\nturning on the power. This procedure helps the drill cut a good starting spot and eliminates the\nchance of the drill slipping off and tracking across the metal. While holding the drill at a 90Â°\nangle, drill the rivet to the depth of its head. Be careful not to drill too deep because the rivet\nshank will turn with the drill and cause a tear. The rivet head will often break away and climb the\ndrill, which is a good signal to withdraw the drill. If the rivet head does not come lose of its own\naccord, insert a drift punch into the hole and twist slightly to either side until the head comes off.\n(4)\nDrive out the shank of the rivet with a drift punch slightly smaller than the diameter of the shank.\nOn thin metal or unsupported structures, support the sheet with a bucking bar while driving out\nthe shank. If the shank is exceptionally tight after the rivet head is removed, drill the rivet about\ntwo-thirds of the way through the thickness of the material and then drive out the remainder of\nthe rivet with a drift punch.\n(5)\nThe removal of ush rivets is the same as that just described except that no ling of the\nmanufactured head is required before center punching. Be very careful to avoid elongation\nof the dimpled or the countersunk holes. The rivet head should be drilled to approximately\none-half the thickness of the top sheet.\nTable 1.

NAS1738M4-4\nrivets may be identied as AIA/NAS1738M4-4.\nC.\nInstallation of Solid Shank Rivets.\n(1)\nA large percentage of riveting of airplane structure is accomplished on thin gauge aluminum alloy,\nand the work must be accomplished without distorting or damaging the material with hammer\nblows or riveting tools. All airplane power riveting is accomplished by upsetting the rivets against\na bucking bar instead of striking the shank with a hammer. To prevent deforming the rivet head,\na rivet set must be selected to t each type of rivet. The depth of this set must not touch material\nbeing riveted. Parts requiring heat treatment should be heat treated before riveting, since heat\ntreating process after rivet installation causes warping. Assemblies that require heat treatment\nin a salt bath must be treated prior to assembly, as the salt cannot be entirely washed out of the\njoints.\n(2)\nThe use of hollow rivets in joining highly stressed parts is not permitted. To determine if blind\nrivets may be substituted, refer to Tables 1 and 2. Selection of the proper rivet and the proper\nnumber of rivets is very important. Rivets must be of the proper length for the total thickness of\nthe parts being riveted. Ordinarily, from 1-1/2 to 2 times the diameter of the rivet is the correct\namount for the rivet shank to protrude through the material to form the head. For heavy material,\nsuch as plates or ttings, from 2 to 2-1/2 times the rivet diameter may be used. The rivet should\nnot be excessively loose in the hole, as this condition will cause the rivet to bend over while\nbeing driven, and the shank will not be sufciently expanded to completely ll the hole. A drill\nfrom 0.002 inch to 0.004 inch larger than the rivet shank should be used for sheet and plate\nriveting. Parts should be held rmly together by clamps, screws, or bolts while they are being\ndrilled or riveted. The bucking bar is to be held against the end of the rivet shank. Exercise care\nwhile accomplishing this operation to prevent unseating the rivet by too much pressure. For the\nrst few blows, the bucking bar should be held lightly against the rivet shank so it will receive\nthe impact of the blow through the rivet. The bucking bar must be held square with the rivet\nto produce uniform upsets. As few blows as possible should be struck to properly upset rivet.\nBlows must be as uniform as possible.\nD.\nLoose Or Working Solid Shank Rivets.\n(1)\nRivets which appear to be loose shall be checked with a 0.002 inch feeler gauge by inserting the\ngauge around the head of the rivet in question. If the feeler gauge can be inserted to the shank\nof the rivet, it shall be classied as a loose rivet and it shall be replaced. If the feeler gauge can\nbe inserted approximately halfway to the shank for less than 30 percent of the circumference\nof the rivet head, it shall not be classied as a loose rivet. The feeler gauge shall be used to\ncheck the shear section between the riveted members (such as skin to spar or different sections\nof skins) in a similar manner to that used around the rivet head. If the skin around the brazier\nhead or countersunk rivet can be moved by depressing the skin with nger pressure around the\nrivet, the rivet shall be replaced. If a rivet is found which turns by applying a rotating load to the\nhead of the rivet, it should be replaced.\n(2)\nIn areas where exterior paint has been applied to rivet heads, the paint may harden due to aging\nprocesses and show hairline cracks around the edge of the rivet heads. This should not be\nused as a basis for determining whether or not the rivet is loose. The hardened paint may crack\nat times and collect dirt or exhaust fumes which will appear as discoloration. It is not possible\nto detect loose rivets visually. Replacement rivets should be of like size and type. In some\ninstances, however, it will be necessary to use the next size larger diameter. For general repair\npractices, the spacing between the centerlines of adjacent rivet holes shall be four diameters or\ngreater. In some areas where the spacing between rivets prohibits the use of the next larger\nrivets, special repair instructions and procedures shall be followed.\nContact Cessna Single\nEngine Support."
