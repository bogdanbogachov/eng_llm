        "question": "What is the relationship between the rib segments and the spars in forming the basic airfoil section of the wing?",
        "answer": "ALERT: All checkup timelines, part replacement schedules, overhaul cycles, the check method, operational limits, usage cycles, etc., set by Cessna are solely based on the use of new, remanufactured, or overhauled certified Cessna parts. If parts are designed, manufactured, remanufactured, overhauled, purchased, and/or approved by external manufacturers, then the data in Cessna’s maintenance/service manuals and parts catalogs do not apply and the purchaser is warned not to rely on such data for non-Cessna parts. All checkup timelines, part replacement schedules, overhaul cycles, the check method, operational limits, usage cycles, etc., for such non-Cessna parts must be obtained from the supplier or maker of such non-Cessna parts.\n\nWING RIB\n1.\nGeneral\nA.\nFlanged upper and lower edges of all ribs serve as cap strips in addition to providing rigidity to the rib.\nThe skin riveted or bonded directly to each rib ange provides the cellular strength for each successive\nrib bay. The nose, center, and trailing rib segments are riveted together through the front and rear\nspars to form the basic airfoil section. Spanwise, Alclad stringers stiffen the skin between ribs.\n2.\nWing Rib Damage Classication\nA.\nDamage to the wing rib can be divided into three major categories and is detailed in Wing Damage\nClassication.\n3.\nWing Rib Repair\nA.\nRepairs to the wing rib are illustrated in Figure 801.\n"
