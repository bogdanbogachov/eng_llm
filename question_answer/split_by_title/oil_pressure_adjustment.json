TCM recommends the Model 20 ATM - C Porta Test Unit P/N 630045-20 ATM-C or\nequivalent to insure the fuel injection system meets all pressure and flow specifications.\nAn alternative procedure would be to use calibrated gauges.  You may acquire a\nModel 20 ATM-C Porta Test Unit by contacting the following company:\n AERO TEST, Inc.\n29300 Goddard Road\nRomulus, Michigan 48174\n(734) 946-9000\n \na. One (1) calibrated 0-60 PSI gauge, graduated in 1 PSI increments. This gauge will be\nused for unmetered pressure measurement.\nb. One (1) calibrated 0-30 PSI gauge, graduated in 1 PSI (maximum) increments. This\ngauge will be used for metered pressure measurements and verification of aircraft\nfuel flow gauge indications."
