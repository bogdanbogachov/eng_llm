Only use OEM instructions and ensure that tool availability is met before proceeding.\n\nOver priming can cause hydrostatic lock and subsequent engine failure.\nCAUTION…Insure propeller area is clear before initiating starting sequence.\nNOTE…Before starting engine, insure that fuel tanks contain proper type of fuel (100LL-blue or\n100 green). Check engine oil sump for proper servicing. See chapter 3 for oil type and\nspecification\nStart the engine in accordance with the airframe manufacturer's Airplane Flight Manual (AFM.)\nOperate the engine at 750 RPM for one minute, gradually increasing RPM to 1000 RPM in\nthree minutes.\nCheck the magneto circuit for proper grounding prior to a normal shut-down. Allow the engine\nto cool adequately and make a visual inspection for any discrepancies. If engine exhibits any\ndiscrepancies, return to the applicable chapter to correct the discrepancy. All discrepancies\nmust be corrected prior to  engine adjustment.\nOil Pressure-Check, If no oil pressure is noted within 30 seconds, shut engine down and\ninvestigate.\nCAUTION…Operation of engine without oil pressure may result in engine malfunction or failure.\nWhen propeller stops rotating, place ignition switch, master switch and fuel selector in off\nposition."
