        "question": "What is the purpose of vacuuming the bay area thoroughly after removing damaged material and smoothing out abrasions in a wing fuel bay, and what types of debris should be removed during this process?",
        "answer": "NOTE: {Instruction} should be followed precisely to ensure compliance with safety and operational standards. Record all actions performed during the sealant application in the aircraft maintenance log.\n\n1.\nPreparing Damaged Area In Wing Fuel Bay for Repair\nA.\nBefore performing any maintenance in fuel bay area, it will be necessary to defuel and purge the fuel\nbay. To defuel and purge the fuel bay, proceed as follows:\nWARNING: During\nall\nfuel\nsystem\nservicing\nprocedures,\nre\nghting\nequipment must be available.\nWARNING: Always ground airplane prior to performing any maintenance of the\nfuel system.\nWARNING: Avoid drainage from residual fuel held in disconnected fuel lines;\nthis accumulation constitutes a re hazard.\nWARNING: Use NS-40 (RAS-4) (Snap-On Tools Corp., Kenosha, Wisconsin),\nMIL-T-83483 (thread compound, anti- seize, graphite petrolatum),\nor engine oil as a thread lubricant or to seal leaking connections.\nApply sparingly to all but rst two threads of male ttings, being\ncareful not to allow entry of compound into fuel system.\nNOTE:\nCovers or caps should be installed on lines and ttings to prevent entry of foreign material,\nand to prevent damage to threads.\n(1)\nGround airplane to a suitable ground stake.\n(2)\nEnsure airplane battery switch is in OFF position.\n(3)\nTurn fuel selector valves to OFF position\n(4)\nRemove fuel ller cap on bay that is to be defueled; insert defueling nozzle.\n(5)\nRemove as much fuel as possible through ller opening.\n(6)\nRemove drain valves from bottom side of fuel bay and drain remaining fuel into a clean, open\ncontainer. Use defueling nozzle to remove fuel from container.\n(7)\nIf necessary, repeat procedures for opposite wing.\nWARNING: Purge fuel bays with an inert gas (argon or carbon dioxide)\nprior\nto\nrepairing\nfuel\nleaks\nto\npreclude\npossibility\nof\nexplosions.\n(8)\nInsert inert gas supply hose into fuel ller opening.\n(9)\nAllow gas to ow into bay for several minutes to remove all fuel vapors. Since argon or carbon\ndioxide are heavier than air, these gasses will remain in bay during repair. Non-sparking tools\nshall be used to make repairs (air motors, plastic scrapers, etc.).\nNOTE:\nPortable vapor detectors are available to determine presence of explosive mixtures\nand are calibrated for leaded fuel. The detectors can be used to determine when it is\nsafe to make repairs.\nNOTE:\nDuring structural repair, parts must be predrilled, countersunk or dimpled, and\ncleaned before being sealed and positioned for nal installation.\n(10) Remove all existing sealant from area to be sealed, leaving a taper to the remaining sealant.\nThe taper will allow a scarf bond and a continuous seal when the new sealant is applied.\nNOTE:\nThe best method of removing sealant is with a chisel-like tool made of hard ber or\nplexiglass. Remaining sealant can be removed with aluminum wool. Steel wool or\nsandpaper must not be used.\n(11) Stop drill cracks using a No. 30 (0.128 inch) drill.\n(12) Remove all ragged edges, dents, tears, cracks, and punctures.\n(13) After removal of damaged area, leave edges parallel to any square or rectangular edge of the\nunit.\nNOTE:\nDamage adjacent to a previous repair requires removal of old repair and inclusion of\nthe entire area in the new repair.\n(14) Round all corners.\n(15) Smooth out abrasions.\n(16) Vacuum thoroughly to remove all chips, lings, dirt, etc., from bay area.\n(17) All surfaces to be sealed after repair should be thoroughly cleaned by wiping with a clean cloth\ndampened with methyl propyl ketone (MPK), acetone or similar solvent, and dried with a clean\ncloth before allowing solvent to evaporate. Always pour the solvent on the cloth to prevent\ncontaminating solvent. Do not allow cloth to drip. Never use contaminated solvent.\n(18) Any repair that breaks the fuel bay seal will require resealing that bay area, refer to applicable\nMaintenance Manual, Chapter 28, Fuel Tank Sealing - Maintenance Practices for sealing\nmaterials and procedures.\n"
