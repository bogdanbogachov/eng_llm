        "question": "What is the significance of the semimonocoque type of structure employed by the wing assemblies, and how does it contribute to the overall strength and durability of the wing?",
        "answer": "1.\nGeneral\nA.\nDescription of Wing Assemblies:\n(1)\nThe wing assemblies are a semicantilever type, employing semimonocoque type of structure.\n(2)\nThe internal structure consists of a built-up front spar, a formed inboard front fuel spar, a rear\nspar, and a formed auxiliary spar assembly in the aileron attach area.\n(3)\nRibs are formed sheet metal, and consist of nose, intermediate and trailing edge assemblies.\n(4)\nOn the 172 series airplanes, stressed skin is riveted to the rib and spar assemblies to complete\nthe rigid structure. On 182 and 206 series airplanes, the skin is bonded to the leading edge ribs\nand riveted at other locations.\n(5)\nThe inboard section of the wing is sealed to form an integral fuel cell. The sealed area runs from\nthe wing root outboard toward the strut attach; and from the front fuel spar to the rear spar.\nNOTE:\nOn the 172 series airplanes, the fuel closeout rib is located approximately 7 inches\noutboard from the wing root.\n(6)\nAccess openings (hand holes with removable cover plates) are located in the wing These\nopenings afford access to ap and aileron bellcranks and control systems, the ap actuator\nin the left hand wing, electrical wiring and wiring disconnect points, the wing portion of the\nventilation system, strut attach ttings, and the inside of the fuel cell.\nB.\nRefer to applicable Maintenance Manual, Chapter 6, Dimensions and Areas, for wing station\ndiagrams.\nC.\nIf questions arise concerning approved repairs, or for repairs not shown in this section, contact Cessna\nPropeller Aircraft Product Support, Box 7706, Wichita, KS 67277.

        "question": "What is the importance of considering the location of stringers when installing a doubler aft of the front spar during access hole creation in wing repair?",
        "answer": "3.\nInstallation of Access Holes\nNOTE:\nIn some instances, it may be advantageous to create access holes in the wing skin to facilitate\nwing repair. Refer to the following steps and Figure 2 for an illustration of access holes.\nWARNING: The following procedures are not applicable to the integral fuel cell\nskins.\nA.\nPrecautions and Notes.\n(1)\nAdd the minimum number of access holes necessary.\n(2)\nAny circular or rectangular access hole which is used with approved optional equipment\ninstallations may be added in lieu of the access hole illustrated.\n(3)\nDo not add access holes at outboard end of wing: remove wing tip instead.\n(4)\nLocate new access holes near the center of a bay (spanwise).\n(5)\nLocate new access holes forward of the front spars as close to the front spar as practical.\n(6)\nLocate new access holes aft of the front spar between the rst and second stringers aft of the\nspar. When installing the doubler, rotate it so the two straight edges are closest to the stringers.\n(7)\nAlternate bays, with new access holes staggered forward and aft of the front spar, are preferable.\n(8)\nA maximum of ve new access holes in each wing is permissible. If more are required, contact\nCessna Propeller Aircraft Product Support.\nB.\nAccess Hole Installation. (Refer to Figure 2)\n(1)\nEstablish exact location for inspection cover and inscribe centerlines.\n(2)\nDetermine position of doubler on wing skin and center over centerlines. Mark the ten rivet hole\nlocations and drill to size shown.\n(3)\nCut out access hole, using dimension shown.\n(4)\nFlex doubler and insert through access hole, and rivet in place.\n(5)\nPosition cover and secure, using screws as shown.\n"
