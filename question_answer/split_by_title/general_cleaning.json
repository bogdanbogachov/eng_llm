        "question": "What types of blasting materials are suitable for removing hard carbon deposits from engine parts using dry blasting techniques?",
        "answer": "WARNING: Inadequate panel replacement of the engine nacelle may compromise aircraft integrity. Always wear insulated gloves, follow approved methods, and check for discoloration before returning to service.\n\nNOTE…Parts listed in Section 6-6, \"100% Replacement Parts,\" must be replaced and\ntherefore do not require cleaning.\nWARNING\nDuring any cleaning process always follow the cleaning material manufacturer's\ninstructions for use, and Material Safety Data Sheets for safety precautions and\ndisposal information.\nEngine components must be thoroughly cleaned so they can be properly inspected. All\nsurfaces must be protected from corrosion after cleaning by rinsing with a petroleum base\nsolvent and applying a coat of clean 50 weight aviation engine oil.\nCAUTION…Cleaning methods other than the following may be destructive to engine parts\nand must not be used.\nAluminum Alloy Parts: Degrease aluminum alloy components by spraying or brushing with\nany fortified mineral spirit solvent. Heavy grease or dirt deposits can be cleaned effectively\nby allowing parts to soak in this solvent for a short period of time. Carbon deposits and gum\n(oil varnish) may be removed easily by immersing the part in a hot bath of an inhibited, mild\nalkaline cleaning solution. Immersion time should be only as long as necessary to remove\nthe deposit. Give special attention to cleaning studs, tapped holes and drilled holes. Caution\nmust be exercised when cleaning aluminum alloy parts using any alkaline cleaning solutions.\nImmediately after removing soaked parts from inhibited, mild alkaline bath or hot soapy\nwater, remove all traces of the alkaline by spraying the parts with a jet of steam, or brushing\nvigorously with a mineral spirit solvent. Cleaned parts may be dried by a jet of dry,\ncompressed air to remove all solvent liquids.\nCAUTION…When using alkaline cleaning solutions, the cleaning solution manufacturer's\nusage, safety data and disposal information must be strictly followed. Alkaline etching\nsolutions must not be used.\nCAUTION…All alkaline residues must be removed from crevices, recesses and holes to\nprevent the formation of a foaming emulsion in the engine lubrication oil after reassembly. If\nAccelagold surface was removed by the cleaning process it must be re-applied in\naccordance with the procedure in section 6-19, \"Application Of Accelagold.\" [Accelagold is\nmanufactured by Turco® Products Inc.]\nCAUTION…Alkaline cleaning solutions will cause corrosion to metals if not completely\nremoved.\nCarbon solvent should be employed only when carbon deposits are too hard or thick for\nremoval by other solvents.\nNo polishing compound, abrasive paste or powder is needed for cleaning engine parts. Do\nnot scrape parts or use wire brushes, sandpaper, abrasive cloth or abrasive wheels.\nScratches resulting from such methods allow concentrated stress at the scratch and may\ncause fatigue failure.\nBlasting techniques can be employed to remove hard carbon deposits if suitable equipment\nis available. Suitable types of grit for dry blasting are plastic pellets and processed natural\nmaterials such as wheat grains and crushed fruit pits or shells. Air pressure must be adjusted\nto the lowest setting that will produce the desired cleaning action. Small holes and machine\nfinished surfaces must be protected from the blast by seals and covers.\nWARNING\nAll cleaning material must be removed from parts and components after cleaning.\nCAUTION…Do not use sand, metal grit or glass beads for any type of cleaning. If water\nmixed degreasing solutions containing caustic compounds or soap are used to clean\naluminum alloy components they must be thoroughly and completely rinsed with clear boiling\nwater or steam to prevent corrosion.\nCASTINGS: Gasket surfaces must be thoroughly cleaned with a suitable hydrocarbon\nsolvent such as acetone, naphtha, or methyl ethyl keytone (MEK) to remove dirt, oil and\ngrease. Surfaces must be clean, dry and free of all old gasket material before applying new\ngaskets.\nSMALL STEEL PARTS: Degrease steel parts by spraying or brushing with mineral spirit\nsolvent. Heavy grease or dirt deposits can be cleaned effectively by allowing the part to soak\nin this solvent for a short period of time.\nNOTE…See Chapters 7 through 17 for specific individual system component and part\ncleaning instructions."

Carbon deposits and gum\n(oil varnish) may be removed easily by immersing the part in a hot bath of an inhibited, mild\nalkaline cleaning solution. Immersion time should be only as long as necessary to remove\nthe deposit. Give special attention to cleaning studs, tapped holes and drilled holes. Caution\nmust be exercised when cleaning aluminum alloy parts using any alkaline cleaning solutions.\nImmediately after removing soaked parts from inhibited, mild alkaline bath or hot soapy\nwater, remove all traces of the alkaline by spraying the parts with a jet of steam, or brushing\nvigorously with a mineral spirit solvent. Cleaned parts may be dried by a jet of dry,\ncompressed air to remove all solvent liquids.\nCAUTION…When using alkaline cleaning solutions, the cleaning solution manufacturer's\nusage, safety data and disposal information must be strictly followed. Alkaline etching\nsolutions must not be used.\nCAUTION…All alkaline residues must be removed from crevices, recesses and holes to\nprevent the formation of a foaming emulsion in the engine lubrication oil after reassembly. If\nAccelagold surface was removed by the cleaning process it must be re-applied in\naccordance with the procedure in section 6-19, \"Application Of Accelagold.\" [Accelagold is\nmanufactured by Turco® Products Inc.]\nCAUTION…Alkaline cleaning solutions will cause corrosion to metals if not completely\nremoved.\nCarbon solvent should be employed only when carbon deposits are too hard or thick for\nremoval by other solvents.\nNo polishing compound, abrasive paste or powder is needed for cleaning engine parts. Do\nnot scrape parts or use wire brushes, sandpaper, abrasive cloth or abrasive wheels.\nScratches resulting from such methods allow concentrated stress at the scratch and may\ncause fatigue failure.\nBlasting techniques can be employed to remove hard carbon deposits if suitable equipment\nis available. Suitable types of grit for dry blasting are plastic pellets and processed natural\nmaterials such as wheat grains and crushed fruit pits or shells. Air pressure must be adjusted\nto the lowest setting that will produce the desired cleaning action. Small holes and machine\nfinished surfaces must be protected from the blast by seals and covers.\nWARNING\nAll cleaning material must be removed from parts and components after cleaning.\nCAUTION…Do not use sand, metal grit or glass beads for any type of cleaning. If water\nmixed degreasing solutions containing caustic compounds or soap are used to clean\naluminum alloy components they must be thoroughly and completely rinsed with clear boiling\nwater or steam to prevent corrosion.\nCASTINGS: Gasket surfaces must be thoroughly cleaned with a suitable hydrocarbon\nsolvent such as acetone, naphtha, or methyl ethyl keytone (MEK) to remove dirt, oil and\ngrease. Surfaces must be clean, dry and free of all old gasket material before applying new\ngaskets.\nSMALL STEEL PARTS: Degrease steel parts by spraying or brushing with mineral spirit\nsolvent. Heavy grease or dirt deposits can be cleaned effectively by allowing the part to soak\nin this solvent for a short period of time.\nNOTE…See Chapters 7 through 17 for specific individual system component and part\ncleaning instructions."
