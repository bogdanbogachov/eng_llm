        "answer": "CAUTION: All maintenance intervals, part replacement schedules, overhaul cycles, the check method, durability limits, rotation limits, etc., set by Cessna are solely based on the use of new, remanufactured, or overhauled certified Cessna parts. If parts are designed, manufactured, remanufactured, overhauled, purchased, and/or approved by third-party suppliers, then the data in Cessna’s maintenance/service manuals and parts catalogs do not apply and the purchaser is warned not to rely on such data for non-Cessna parts. All maintenance intervals, part replacement schedules, overhaul cycles, the check method, durability limits, rotation limits, etc., for such non-Cessna parts must be obtained from the producer or distributor of such non-Cessna parts.\n\nENGINE COWLING REPAIRS\n1.\nGeneral\nA.\nThis section provides repair procedures for the cowl skins and reinforcement angles.\n2.\nRepair of Cowling Skins\nA.\nCowl halves are made of formed aluminum skin. If extensively damaged, complete sections of cowling\nmust be replaced. Standard insert-type skin patches, however, may be used if repair parts are formed\nto t. Small cracks may be stop drilled and dents straightened if they are reinforced on the inner side\nwith a doubler of the same material.\n3.\nRepair of Reinforcement Angles\nA.\nDue to their small size, cowl reinforcement angles should be replaced (rather than repaired) if they\nbecome damaged.\n"
