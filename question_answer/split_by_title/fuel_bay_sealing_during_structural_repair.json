Stir the accelerator to absorb all oating liquid before it is mixed with the\nsealant. The accelerator can then be poured into the container of sealant for mixing; otherwise, a\nwax-free container must be used. Stir accelerator and sealant until they become a uniform mixture.\nDo not stir air into mixture so it forms bubbles; if bubbles appear, they must be removed.\nCAUTION: Protect drain holes and fuel outlet screens when applying sealants.\nNOTE:\nWork life of sealants contained in SK210-56 is 2 hours from the start of mixing. Work life\nof sealants contained in SK210-101 is one-half hour from the start of mixing. This is based\non a standard condition of 77°F (25°C) and 50 percent relative humidi ty. An increase in\neither temperature or humidity will shorten the work life of the sealants."

Repair parts that\nneed sealing must be installed during the sealing operations. All joints within the boundary of the\nbay, but which do not provide a direct fuel path out of the bay (such as fuel spar anges and rib\nanges), must be fay-surface-sealed and llet sealed on the fuel side. Fay surface sealing is applying\nsealant to one mating part before assembly. Enough sealant must be applied so it will squeeze out\ncompletely around joint when the parts are fastened together. The llet seal is applied after the joint\nis fay-surface-sealed and fastened. Sealer is (llet) applied to the edge of all riveted joints, joggles,\nbend reliefs, voids, rivets, or fasteners. All boundaries and any other place that could become a fuel\nleak are sealed. The fay sealant need not be cured before applying the llet sealer; however, the fay\nsealant must be free of dirt or other contaminants before applying llet seal.

Fuel can ow along a seam or structure of the wing for\nseveral inches, making the leak source difcult to nd. A stained area is an indication of the leak\nsource. Fuel leaks can be found by testing the complete bay as described in Testing Integral Fuel\nBay. Another method of detecting the source of a fuel leak is to remove access doors and blow with\nan air nozzle from the inside of the bay in the area of the leak while soap bubble solution is applied to\nthe outside of the bay. After the leak source has been found, proceed as follows:\n(1)\nRemove existing sealant in the area of the leak as described in Chapter 57, Wing Fuel Bay\nRepairs.\n(2)\nClean the area and apply a llet seal. Press sealant into leaking area with a small paddle,\nworking out all air bubbles.\n(3)\nIf leakage occurs around a rivet or bolt, restrike the rivet or loosen bolt, retorque, and reseal\naround nutplate.\n(4)\nApply fay surface door sealant to access doors, fuel quantity transmitters, etc., if removed, and\ninstall.\n(5)\nTest fuel bay for leakage as outlined in Testing Integral Fuel Bay."

Stir the accelerator to absorb all oating liquid before it is mixed with the\nsealant. The accelerator can then be poured into the container of sealant for mixing; otherwise, a\nwax-free container must be used. Stir accelerator and sealant until they become a uniform mixture.\nDo not stir air into mixture so it forms bubbles; if bubbles appear, they must be removed.\nCAUTION: Protect drain holes and fuel outlet screens when applying sealants.\nNOTE:\nWork life of sealants contained in SK210-56 is 2 hours from the start of mixing. Work life\nof sealants contained in SK210-101 is one-half hour from the start of mixing. This is based\non a standard condition of 77°F (25°C) and 50 percent relative humidi ty.

If parts are designed, manufactured, remanufactured, overhauled, purchased, and/or approved by third-party suppliers, then the data in Cessna’s maintenance/service manuals and parts catalogs do not apply and the purchaser is warned not to rely on such data for non-Cessna parts. All maintenance intervals, part replacement schedules, overhaul cycles, the check method, durability limits, rotation limits, etc., for such non-Cessna parts must be obtained from the producer or distributor of such non-Cessna parts.\n\n1.\nGeneral\nA.\nAny repair that breaks the fuel bay seal will necessitate resealing that bay area. Repair parts that\nneed sealing must be installed during the sealing operations. All joints within the boundary of the\nbay, but which do not provide a direct fuel path out of the bay (such as fuel spar anges and rib\nanges), must be fay-surface-sealed and llet sealed on the fuel side. Fay surface sealing is applying\nsealant to one mating part before assembly. Enough sealant must be applied so it will squeeze out\ncompletely around joint when the parts are fastened together. The llet seal is applied after the joint\nis fay-surface-sealed and fastened. Sealer is (llet) applied to the edge of all riveted joints, joggles,\nbend reliefs, voids, rivets, or fasteners. All boundaries and any other place that could become a fuel\nleak are sealed. The fay sealant need not be cured before applying the llet sealer; however, the fay\nsealant must be free of dirt or other contaminants before applying llet seal. Fillets laid on intersecting\njoints shall be joined together to produce a continuous seal. Sealant must be pressed into the joint to\ndisplace any entrapped air bubbles. Use an extrusion gun to lay a bead along joint, and work out all\nentrapped air with a small paddle to eliminate bubbles."

Repair parts that\nneed sealing must be installed during the sealing operations. All joints within the boundary of the\nbay, but which do not provide a direct fuel path out of the bay (such as fuel spar anges and rib\nanges), must be fay-surface-sealed and llet sealed on the fuel side. Fay surface sealing is applying\nsealant to one mating part before assembly. Enough sealant must be applied so it will squeeze out\ncompletely around joint when the parts are fastened together. The llet seal is applied after the joint\nis fay-surface-sealed and fastened. Sealer is (llet) applied to the edge of all riveted joints, joggles,\nbend reliefs, voids, rivets, or fasteners. All boundaries and any other place that could become a fuel\nleak are sealed. The fay sealant need not be cured before applying the llet sealer; however, the fay\nsealant must be free of dirt or other contaminants before applying llet seal. Fillets laid on intersecting\njoints shall be joined together to produce a continuous seal. Sealant must be pressed into the joint to\ndisplace any entrapped air bubbles. Use an extrusion gun to lay a bead along joint, and work out all\nentrapped air with a small paddle to eliminate bubbles."

All inspection schedules, changeover timelines, refurbishment limits, the inspection procedure, lifespan thresholds, rotation limits, etc., for such non-Cessna parts must be obtained from the vendor or originator of such non-Cessna parts.\n\n6.\nCuring Time\nA.\nClass B-2 sealant has a maximum tack free time of 40 hours and a maximum cure time of 72 hours.\nThese values are based on a standard condition of 77°F (25°C) and 50 percent relative humidity.\nB.\nClass B-1/2 sealant has a maximum tack free time of 10 hours and a maximum cure time of 30 hours.\nThese values are based on a standard condition of 77°F (25°C) and 50 percent relative humidity.\nC.\nThe cure of sealants can be accelerated by an increase in temperature and/or relative humidity. Warm\ncirculating air at a temperature not to exceed 140°F (60°C) may be used to ac celerate cure. Heat\nlamps may be used if the surface temperature of the sealant does not exceed 140°F (60°C). At\ntemperatures above 120°F (49°C), the relative humidity wil l normally be so low (below 40 percent)\nthat sealant curing will be retarded. If necessary, the relative humidity may be increased by the use of\nwater containing less than 100 parts per million total solids and less the 10 parts per million chlorides."
