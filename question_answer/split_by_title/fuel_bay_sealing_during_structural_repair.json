        "question": "What conditions must the fay sealant meet before applying the fillet sealer to the joints within the boundary of a fuel bay during repair operations?",
        "answer": "1.\nGeneral\nA.\nAny repair that breaks the fuel bay seal will necessitate resealing that bay area. Repair parts that\nneed sealing must be installed during the sealing operations. All joints within the boundary of the\nbay, but which do not provide a direct fuel path out of the bay (such as fuel spar anges and rib\nanges), must be fay-surface-sealed and llet sealed on the fuel side. Fay surface sealing is applying\nsealant to one mating part before assembly. Enough sealant must be applied so it will squeeze out\ncompletely around joint when the parts are fastened together. The llet seal is applied after the joint\nis fay-surface-sealed and fastened. Sealer is (llet) applied to the edge of all riveted joints, joggles,\nbend reliefs, voids, rivets, or fasteners. All boundaries and any other place that could become a fuel\nleak are sealed. The fay sealant need not be cured before applying the llet sealer; however, the fay\nsealant must be free of dirt or other contaminants before applying llet seal. Fillets laid on intersecting\njoints shall be joined together to produce a continuous seal. Sealant must be pressed into the joint to\ndisplace any entrapped air bubbles. Use an extrusion gun to lay a bead along joint, and work out all\nentrapped air with a small paddle to eliminate bubbles."

        "answer": "1.\nGeneral\nA.\nAny repair that breaks the fuel bay seal will necessitate resealing that bay area. Repair parts that\nneed sealing must be installed during the sealing operations. All joints within the boundary of the\nbay, but which do not provide a direct fuel path out of the bay (such as fuel spar anges and rib\nanges), must be fay-surface-sealed and llet sealed on the fuel side. Fay surface sealing is applying\nsealant to one mating part before assembly. Enough sealant must be applied so it will squeeze out\ncompletely around joint when the parts are fastened together. The llet seal is applied after the joint\nis fay-surface-sealed and fastened. Sealer is (llet) applied to the edge of all riveted joints, joggles,\nbend reliefs, voids, rivets, or fasteners. All boundaries and any other place that could become a fuel\nleak are sealed. The fay sealant need not be cured before applying the llet sealer; however, the fay\nsealant must be free of dirt or other contaminants before applying llet seal. Fillets laid on intersecting\njoints shall be joined together to produce a continuous seal. Sealant must be pressed into the joint to\ndisplace any entrapped air bubbles. Use an extrusion gun to lay a bead along joint, and work out all\nentrapped air with a small paddle to eliminate bubbles."

        "answer": "7.\nTesting Integral Fuel Bay\nA.\nThe fuel system consists of two vented, integral fuel tanks (one in each wing).\nThe following\nprocedures are for testing integral fuel bay.\n(1)\nRemove vent line from vent tting and cap tting.\n(2)\nDisconnect fuel lines from bay.\n(3)\nTo one of the bay ttings, attach a water manometer capable of measuring 20 inches of water.\n(4)\nTo the other bay tting, connect a well-regulated supply of air (1/2 psi maximum, or 13.8 inches\nof water). Nitrogen may be used where the bay might be exposed to temperature changes while\ntesting.\n(5)\nMake sure ller cap is installed and sealed.\nCAUTION: Do not attempt to apply pressure to the bay without a good regulator\nand a positive shutoff in the supply line. Do not pressurize the fuel\nbay to more than one-half psi or damage may occur.\n(6)\nApply pressure slowly until one-half psi is obtained.\n(7)\nApply a soap solution as required.\n(8)\nAllow 15 to 30 minutes for pressure to stabilize.\n(9)\nIf bay holds for 15 minutes, without pressure loss, bay is acceptable.\n(10) Reseal and retest if any leaks are found.\n"

        "question": "What happens to the sealant when parts that have been fay-surface-sealed are fastened together during fuel bay repair operations?",
        "answer": "1.\nGeneral\nA.\nAny repair that breaks the fuel bay seal will necessitate resealing that bay area. Repair parts that\nneed sealing must be installed during the sealing operations. All joints within the boundary of the\nbay, but which do not provide a direct fuel path out of the bay (such as fuel spar anges and rib\nanges), must be fay-surface-sealed and llet sealed on the fuel side. Fay surface sealing is applying\nsealant to one mating part before assembly. Enough sealant must be applied so it will squeeze out\ncompletely around joint when the parts are fastened together. The llet seal is applied after the joint\nis fay-surface-sealed and fastened. Sealer is (llet) applied to the edge of all riveted joints, joggles,\nbend reliefs, voids, rivets, or fasteners. All boundaries and any other place that could become a fuel\nleak are sealed. The fay sealant need not be cured before applying the llet sealer; however, the fay\nsealant must be free of dirt or other contaminants before applying llet seal. Fillets laid on intersecting\njoints shall be joined together to produce a continuous seal. Sealant must be pressed into the joint to\ndisplace any entrapped air bubbles. Use an extrusion gun to lay a bead along joint, and work out all\nentrapped air with a small paddle to eliminate bubbles."

        "question": "How does the composition of the Service Kit SK210-56 support the application of the Integral Fuel Bay Sealant, considering the specific requirements of the sealants and accelerators included?",
        "answer": "2.\nIntegral Fuel Bay Sealant\nA.\nTwo types of sealants are used, one to seal the bay and the other to seal access doors, fuel quantity\ntransmitters, fuel inlet assemblies, and fuel test receptacle. The access door sealant is more pliable,\nand will not adhere to metal as rmly as the bay sealant. This permits access doors, fuel quantity\ntransmitter, etc., to be removed without damage. Service Kit SK210-56, available from Cessna Parts\nDistribution, contains Type I Class B-2 and Type VIII Class B-2 (access) sealants with Cessna Parts\nDistribution, contains Type I Class B-1/2 and Type VIII Class B-12 (access) sealants with the proper\nquantity of accelerator for each sealant.\nWARNING: The accelerators contain heavy metal peroxides. Keep them away\nfrom heat and ame. Use only in well-ventilated areas. Avoid skin\nand eye contact. Wear eye shields. In case of eye contact, ush\ngenerously with water and get prompt medical attention."

Another method of detecting the source of a fuel leak is to remove access doors and blow with\nan air nozzle from the inside of the bay in the area of the leak while soap bubble solution is applied to\nthe outside of the bay. After the leak source has been found, proceed as follows:\n(1)\nRemove existing sealant in the area of the leak as described in Chapter 57, Wing Fuel Bay\nRepairs.\n(2)\nClean the area and apply a llet seal. Press sealant into leaking area with a small paddle,\nworking out all air bubbles.\n(3)\nIf leakage occurs around a rivet or bolt, restrike the rivet or loosen bolt, retorque, and reseal\naround nutplate.\n(4)\nApply fay surface door sealant to access doors, fuel quantity transmitters, etc., if removed, and\ninstall.\n(5)\nTest fuel bay for leakage as outlined in Testing Integral Fuel Bay."
