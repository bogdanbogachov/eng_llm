Press new bearing (23) onto worm shaft (19). Press bearing until seated against flange.\nAssemble shaft (19), new woodruff key (21), new spring (20) and worm gear (22). Coat the\nworm gear teeth with clean molyshield grease. Insert assembly into adapter housing and\ninstall new retaining ring (24). Insure that retaining ring (24) is properly seated.\n2.

Install a new roller\nbearing (12) in worm wheel (11) to the required specifications. Install new clutch spring (14)\non worm wheel (11). Turn spring so it tends to unwind until offset end drops into the worm\nwheel gear land. Position spring on gear so screw notch is aligned with screw hole in gear\nweb. Install new tab washer (15) and screw (16). Torque screw (16) to 75.0-85.0 inch\npounds torque, and bend tab up against screw head.\n3. Lubricate spring and shaft gear liberally with clean 50 weight. aviation engine oil. Press\nworm wheel and spring assembly onto shaft gear (13). Install new ball bearing (17) on\nshaftgear (13) and secure with new retaining ring (18). Make sure retaining ring seats\nproperly in it’s groove.
