        "answer": "WARNING: Inadequate panel replacement of the engine nacelle may compromise aircraft integrity. Always wear insulated gloves, follow approved methods, and check for discoloration before returning to service.\n\n1. Press new bearing (23) onto worm shaft (19). Press bearing until seated against flange.\nAssemble shaft (19), new woodruff key (21), new spring (20) and worm gear (22). Coat the\nworm gear teeth with clean molyshield grease. Insert assembly into adapter housing and\ninstall new retaining ring (24). Insure that retaining ring (24) is properly seated.\n2. Using an arbor press and an installation tool conforming with the specifications in Figure\n13-7,\" remove roller bearing (12) from worm wheel (11) and discard. Install a new roller\nbearing (12) in worm wheel (11) to the required specifications. Install new clutch spring (14)\non worm wheel (11). Turn spring so it tends to unwind until offset end drops into the worm\nwheel gear land. Position spring on gear so screw notch is aligned with screw hole in gear\nweb. Install new tab washer (15) and screw (16). Torque screw (16) to 75.0-85.0 inch\npounds torque, and bend tab up against screw head.\n3. Lubricate spring and shaft gear liberally with clean 50 weight. aviation engine oil. Press\nworm wheel and spring assembly onto shaft gear (13). Install new ball bearing (17) on\nshaftgear (13) and secure with new retaining ring (18). Make sure retaining ring seats\nproperly in it’s groove. Insert shaft gear and worm wheel assembly into adapter. Make sure\nworm wheel and worm gear teeth are aligned."
