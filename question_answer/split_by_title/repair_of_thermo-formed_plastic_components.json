        "question": "What is the suggested course of action when the damaged area of a thermo-formed plastic is too large to be effectively repaired?",
        "answer": "WARNING: Inadequate panel replacement of the engine nacelle may compromise aircraft integrity. Always wear insulated gloves, follow approved methods, and check for discoloration before returning to service.\n\n1.\nThermo-formed Thermo Plastic Repair\nA.\nRepair of puncture or holes in thermo-formed plastics can be made by trimming out the damaged\narea, removing any paint in the area, and installing an overlapping, beveled, or ush patch of identical\nmaterial. Doublers may be installed behind the patch where additional strength is desired. MPK,\nor any commercially available solvent that will soften and dissolve the plastic, may be used as the\nbonding agent. Dissolving some of the plastic shavings in the solvent will furnish additional working\ntime. Moderate pressure is recommended for best results. Curing time will vary with the agent used,\nbut repairs should not be strained until fully cured. Cracks can be repaired by saturating the crack itself\nwith the solvent, then lling with an epoxy ller or a paste made of the plastic shavings and the solvent.\nAgain, the crack may be reinforced with a doubler on the back side for additional strength. After\nthe repair has been made, the area may be sanded smooth and painted. Parts that are extensively\ndamaged should be replaced instead of repaired."

        "question": "What is the purpose of using an overlapping, beveled, or ush patch when repairing punctures or holes in thermo-formed plastics?",
        "answer": "WARNING: Inadequate panel replacement of the engine nacelle may compromise aircraft integrity. Always wear insulated gloves, follow approved methods, and check for discoloration before returning to service.\n\n1.\nThermo-formed Thermo Plastic Repair\nA.\nRepair of puncture or holes in thermo-formed plastics can be made by trimming out the damaged\narea, removing any paint in the area, and installing an overlapping, beveled, or ush patch of identical\nmaterial. Doublers may be installed behind the patch where additional strength is desired. MPK,\nor any commercially available solvent that will soften and dissolve the plastic, may be used as the\nbonding agent. Dissolving some of the plastic shavings in the solvent will furnish additional working\ntime. Moderate pressure is recommended for best results. Curing time will vary with the agent used,\nbut repairs should not be strained until fully cured. Cracks can be repaired by saturating the crack itself\nwith the solvent, then lling with an epoxy ller or a paste made of the plastic shavings and the solvent.\nAgain, the crack may be reinforced with a doubler on the back side for additional strength. After\nthe repair has been made, the area may be sanded smooth and painted. Parts that are extensively\ndamaged should be replaced instead of repaired."
