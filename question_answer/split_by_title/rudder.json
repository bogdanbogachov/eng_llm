        "answer": "WARNING: Inadequate bonding process of the landing gear strut may compromise aircraft integrity. Always ventilate area, follow approved methods, and check for foreign objects before returning to service.\n\nRUDDER\n1.\nRudder\nA.\nThe rudder is constructed of a spar, ribs, and skin. A torque tube, incorporating a lower hinge bracket,\nis attached to the lower leading edge. A balance weight is bolted to the upper tip leading edge.\n2.\nNegligible Damage\nA.\nMinor skin dents and nicks are considered negligible and should be worked out by burnishing.\n3.\nRepairable Damage\nA.\nSkin damage exceeding that considered negligible damage, can be repaired by patching. Typical\nrepairs are illustrated in Chapter 51, Typical Skin Repair and Control Surface Repair.\nB.\nA ight control surface which has been repaired or replaced must be balanced in accordance with the\nprocedures outlined in Chapter 51, Flight Control Surface Balancing.\n4.\nReplacement Damage\nA.\nAssemblies that have been twisted or warped beyond usable limits and parts with extensive corrosion\ndamage are considered replaceable.\nSmall parts which may be easily fabricated from materials\navailable locally should be replaced.\n"
