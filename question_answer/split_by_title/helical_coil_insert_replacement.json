Helical coil inserts are available in both National Course and\nNational Fine series in lengths equal to 1, 1 -1 /2 and 2 times nominal diameter and in pipe\nthread sizes. They are made of either carbon steel, phosphor bronze or stainless steel, as\nspecified by part number. They are supplied with or without a notch above the driving tang.\nThe notch is provided to facilitate breaking off the tang in open holes.\nHelical coil inserts are helical coils of wire with a diamond-shaped cross section forming both\na male and female thread. When compressed into a special tapped hole at the widest part of\nthe wire, between male and female threads, the diameter of the insert is equal to the nominal\nscrew size. The special finishing taps size the casting hole so the pitch diameter of the\nfemale thread of the installed insert conforms to Class 3 fit with standard bolt threads or class\n4 (tight) fit with standard-size studs. The difference in fit is due to a difference in pitch\ndiameters of bolts and studs. Only one set of helical coil special taps is required for\ninstallation of these inserts in both bolt holes and stud holes. Tap drilling depths and tapping\ndepth for helical coil inserts to be installed in blind holes should conform to the\nrecommendations relative to inserts of length equal to 2 times nominal diameter, as tabulated\nin the manufacturer's Bulletin Numbers 1000 and T4000 latest revision. Helical coil tap drills\nand special taps must be run in perpendicular to the machined surface of the casting. Drilling\nmust be done in a drill press after the casting is firmly supported, clamped and alignment\nchecked. The tap will tend to follow the drilled hole. For drilling and tapping aluminum alloy\ncastings use a commercial grade cutting lubrication oil to prevent overheating of the metal\nand tearing of the thread."

When compressed into a special tapped hole at the widest part of\nthe wire, between male and female threads, the diameter of the insert is equal to the nominal\nscrew size. The special finishing taps size the casting hole so the pitch diameter of the\nfemale thread of the installed insert conforms to Class 3 fit with standard bolt threads or class\n4 (tight) fit with standard-size studs. The difference in fit is due to a difference in pitch\ndiameters of bolts and studs. Only one set of helical coil special taps is required for\ninstallation of these inserts in both bolt holes and stud holes. Tap drilling depths and tapping\ndepth for helical coil inserts to be installed in blind holes should conform to the\nrecommendations relative to inserts of length equal to 2 times nominal diameter, as tabulated\nin the manufacturer's Bulletin Numbers 1000 and T4000 latest revision. Helical coil tap drills\nand special taps must be run in perpendicular to the machined surface of the casting. Drilling\nmust be done in a drill press after the casting is firmly supported, clamped and alignment\nchecked. The tap will tend to follow the drilled hole.
