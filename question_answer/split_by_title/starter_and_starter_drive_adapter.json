All checkup timelines, changeover timelines, overhaul cycles, the assessment technique, durability limits, rotation limits, etc., for such non-Cessna parts must be obtained from the supplier or maker of such non-Cessna parts.\n\n1. Place the starter adapter shaftgear in a shielded vise. Remove retaining ring (17), using\nsnap ring pliers. Insert worm shaft tool into the worm shaft slot and rotate the shaft\ncounterclockwise to break bearing (16) loose from the housing. Remove bearing (16) and\nshaft assembly (12 through 16). Separate worm gear (12), spring (13), woodruff key (15)\nand shaft (14). It may be necessary to use an arbor press to remove ball bearing (16)\nfrom shaft (14). Discard retaining ring (17), bearing (16), spring (13) and woodruff key\n(15).\n2. Clamp shaft gear (18) in shielded vise jaws and remove 12 point self locking nut (46).\nRemove sleeve (44) and spacer (45) or airframe supplied sheave, as used, from shaft.\nRemove four sets of attaching parts (36, 37 & 38) and oil seal retainer clip (51). Tap\nscavenge pump body (35) using a plastic or rawhide mallet and remove. Remove gear\n(34), oil seal (43), ball bearing (41) and spacer (42). Discard 12 point self locking nut\n(46), lock washers (37), oil seal (43) and ball bearing (41).\nNOTE... Do not clamp adapter housing in vise.\n3. Remove three sets of attaching parts (28 & 29). Using an inertia puller or other suitable\ntool, detach cover assembly (27) and o-ring (26) from starter adapter. Discard o-ring (26).\n4. Clamp starter shaftgear teeth in shielded vise jaws. Remove and discard retaining ring\n(25). Use a starter adapter disassembly tool as shown in Figure 13-2. Rotate the worm\nwheel gear in counterclockwise direction at the same time pull axially on the worm wheel\nand spring to separate it from the starter shaft gear. Remove starter shaft gear (18) from\nvise. Separate shaftgear (18) from housing (5)."

        "question": "What components are removed along with the scavenge pump body when it is tapped and removed from the shaft during the disassembly of the starter adapter shaftgear?",
        "answer": "NOTICE: All checkup timelines, part replacement schedules, overhaul cycles, the check method, lifespan thresholds, rotation limits, etc., set by Cessna are solely based on the use of new, remanufactured, or overhauled certified Cessna parts. If parts are designed, manufactured, remanufactured, overhauled, purchased, and/or approved by external manufacturers, then the data in Cessna’s maintenance/service manuals and parts catalogs are not suitable and the purchaser is warned not to rely on such data for non-Cessna parts. All checkup timelines, part replacement schedules, overhaul cycles, the check method, lifespan thresholds, rotation limits, etc., for such non-Cessna parts must be obtained from the vendor or originator of such non-Cessna parts.\n\n1. Place the starter adapter shaftgear in a shielded vise. Remove retaining ring (17), using\nsnap ring pliers. Insert worm shaft tool into the worm shaft slot and rotate the shaft\ncounterclockwise to break bearing (16) loose from the housing. Remove bearing (16) and\nshaft assembly (12 through 16). Separate worm gear (12), spring (13), woodruff key (15)\nand shaft (14). It may be necessary to use an arbor press to remove ball bearing (16)\nfrom shaft (14). Discard retaining ring (17), bearing (16), spring (13) and woodruff key\n(15).\n2. Clamp shaft gear (18) in shielded vise jaws and remove 12 point self locking nut (46).\nRemove sleeve (44) and spacer (45) or airframe supplied sheave, as used, from shaft.\nRemove four sets of attaching parts (36, 37 & 38) and oil seal retainer clip (51). Tap\nscavenge pump body (35) using a plastic or rawhide mallet and remove. Remove gear\n(34), oil seal (43), ball bearing (41) and spacer (42). Discard 12 point self locking nut\n(46), lock washers (37), oil seal (43) and ball bearing (41).\nNOTE... Do not clamp adapter housing in vise.\n3. Remove three sets of attaching parts (28 & 29). Using an inertia puller or other suitable\ntool, detach cover assembly (27) and o-ring (26) from starter adapter. Discard o-ring (26).\n4. Clamp starter shaftgear teeth in shielded vise jaws. Remove and discard retaining ring\n(25). Use a starter adapter disassembly tool as shown in Figure 13-2. Rotate the worm\nwheel gear in counterclockwise direction at the same time pull axially on the worm wheel\nand spring to separate it from the starter shaft gear. Remove starter shaft gear (18) from\nvise. Separate shaftgear (18) from housing (5)."

Clamp worm wheel in shielded vise. Remove clutch spring retaining screw (22) and tab\nwasher (21). Place a straight slot screw driver through a hole in the worm wheel (20) to\ncatch the end of spring (19). Rotate spring (19) clockwise to release it from the land in\nthe worm wheel gear. Separate spring (19) from worm wheel gear (20). Remove roller\nbearing (23) from worm wheel gear (20).\n6. Use a slide hammer and Borrough's 8093C Bearing Puller or equivalent to remove\nneedle bearing (11) from housing (5)."
