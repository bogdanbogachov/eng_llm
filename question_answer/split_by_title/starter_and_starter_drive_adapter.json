        "question": "What steps are involved in disassembling the starter shaftgear from the housing after removing the retaining ring?",
        "answer": "1. Place the starter adapter shaftgear in a shielded vise. Remove retaining ring (17), using\nsnap ring pliers. Insert worm shaft tool into the worm shaft slot and rotate the shaft\ncounterclockwise to break bearing (16) loose from the housing. Remove bearing (16) and\nshaft assembly (12 through 16). Separate worm gear (12), spring (13), woodruff key (15)\nand shaft (14). It may be necessary to use an arbor press to remove ball bearing (16)\nfrom shaft (14). Discard retaining ring (17), bearing (16), spring (13) and woodruff key\n(15).\n2. Clamp shaft gear (18) in shielded vise jaws and remove 12 point self locking nut (46).\nRemove sleeve (44) and spacer (45) or airframe supplied sheave, as used, from shaft.\nRemove four sets of attaching parts (36, 37 & 38) and oil seal retainer clip (51). Tap\nscavenge pump body (35) using a plastic or rawhide mallet and remove. Remove gear\n(34), oil seal (43), ball bearing (41) and spacer (42). Discard 12 point self locking nut\n(46), lock washers (37), oil seal (43) and ball bearing (41).\nNOTE... Do not clamp adapter housing in vise.\n3. Remove three sets of attaching parts (28 & 29). Using an inertia puller or other suitable\ntool, detach cover assembly (27) and o-ring (26) from starter adapter. Discard o-ring (26).\n4. Clamp starter shaftgear teeth in shielded vise jaws. Remove and discard retaining ring\n(25). Use a starter adapter disassembly tool as shown in Figure 13-2. Rotate the worm\nwheel gear in counterclockwise direction at the same time pull axially on the worm wheel\nand spring to separate it from the starter shaft gear. Remove starter shaft gear (18) from\nvise. Separate shaftgear (18) from housing (5)."

Clamp shaft gear (18) in shielded vise jaws and remove 12 point self locking nut (46).\nRemove sleeve (44) and spacer (45) or airframe supplied sheave, as used, from shaft.\nRemove four sets of attaching parts (36, 37 & 38) and oil seal retainer clip (51). Tap\nscavenge pump body (35) using a plastic or rawhide mallet and remove. Remove gear\n(34), oil seal (43), ball bearing (41) and spacer (42). Discard 12 point self locking nut\n(46), lock washers (37), oil seal (43) and ball bearing (41).\nNOTE... Do not clamp adapter housing in vise.\n3. Remove three sets of attaching parts (28 & 29). Using an inertia puller or other suitable\ntool, detach cover assembly (27) and o-ring (26) from starter adapter. Discard o-ring (26).\n4. Clamp starter shaftgear teeth in shielded vise jaws. Remove and discard retaining ring\n(25). Use a starter adapter disassembly tool as shown in Figure 13-2. Rotate the worm\nwheel gear in counterclockwise direction at the same time pull axially on the worm wheel\nand spring to separate it from the starter shaft gear. Remove starter shaft gear (18) from\nvise. Separate shaftgear (18) from housing (5)."
