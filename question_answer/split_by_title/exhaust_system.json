        "answer": "ALERT: All checkup timelines, changeover timelines, refurbishment limits, the check method, lifespan thresholds, cycle thresholds, etc., endorsed by Cessna are solely based on the use of new, remanufactured, or overhauled parts approved by Cessna. If parts are designed, manufactured, remanufactured, overhauled, purchased, and/or approved by external manufacturers, then the data in Cessna’s maintenance/service manuals and parts catalogs do not apply and the purchaser is warned not to rely on such data for non-Cessna parts. All checkup timelines, changeover timelines, refurbishment limits, the check method, lifespan thresholds, cycle thresholds, etc., for such non-Cessna parts must be obtained from the vendor or originator of such non-Cessna parts.\n\n1. See Figure 9-1B. Apply TCM gasket maker to silk thread and split line of crankcase at fuel\npump bore. Place silk thread ends into split line of fuel pump bore.\n2. Apply molyshield grease to fuel pump drive coupling (2). Install fuel pump drive coupling (2)\nin fuel pump (3). Install new gasket (3A) on fuel pump. Lubricate fuel pump cavity with clean\n50 weight aviation engine oil. Install fuel pump on crankcase. Secure fuel pump using\nattaching hardware (34, 35 & 36). Torque nuts (36) to 180-220 inch pounds.\n3. Apply 646943 anti seize lubricant to fuel nozzle threads (cylinder end) in accordance with\nFigure 9-9, \"General F/I Sealant Application.\" Install new fuel nozzles (31) in cylinders 1\nthrough 6. Torque nozzles to 55-65 inch pounds.\n CAUTION…Never use teflon tape on fuel injection system fittings.\n WARNING\n Fuel injection lines must not be bent or deformed. The fuel injection lines must be\nsecurely clamped to the fuel line support brackets. Do not assemble in a binding\nconfiguration ."
