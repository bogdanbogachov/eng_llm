        "question": "What is the role of the attaching hardware (34, 35 & 36) in the installation process of the fuel pump on the crankcase?",
        "answer": "WARNING: Inadequate sealant application of the landing gear strut may compromise aircraft integrity. Always wear insulated gloves, follow approved methods, and check for foreign objects before returning to service.\n\n1. See Figure 9-1B. Apply TCM gasket maker to silk thread and split line of crankcase at fuel\npump bore. Place silk thread ends into split line of fuel pump bore.\n2. Apply molyshield grease to fuel pump drive coupling (2). Install fuel pump drive coupling (2)\nin fuel pump (3). Install new gasket (3A) on fuel pump. Lubricate fuel pump cavity with clean\n50 weight aviation engine oil. Install fuel pump on crankcase. Secure fuel pump using\nattaching hardware (34, 35 & 36). Torque nuts (36) to 180-220 inch pounds.\n3. Apply 646943 anti seize lubricant to fuel nozzle threads (cylinder end) in accordance with\nFigure 9-9, \"General F/I Sealant Application.\" Install new fuel nozzles (31) in cylinders 1\nthrough 6. Torque nozzles to 55-65 inch pounds.\n CAUTION…Never use teflon tape on fuel injection system fittings.\n WARNING\n Fuel injection lines must not be bent or deformed. The fuel injection lines must be\nsecurely clamped to the fuel line support brackets. Do not assemble in a binding\nconfiguration ."
