        "question": "What is the benefit of replacing components like cotter pins, safety wire, and lock washers with new parts during maintenance or overhaul, in the context of ensuring the overall integrity of the engine or component, as outlined in the rules for 100 percent replacement parts?",
        "answer": "CAUTION: All maintenance intervals, part replacement schedules, overhaul cycles, the check method, durability limits, rotation limits, etc., set by Cessna are solely based on the use of new, remanufactured, or overhauled certified Cessna parts. If parts are designed, manufactured, remanufactured, overhauled, purchased, and/or approved by third-party suppliers, then the data in Cessna’s maintenance/service manuals and parts catalogs do not apply and the purchaser is warned not to rely on such data for non-Cessna parts. All maintenance intervals, part replacement schedules, overhaul cycles, the check method, durability limits, rotation limits, etc., for such non-Cessna parts must be obtained from the producer or distributor of such non-Cessna parts.\n\nDiscard all parts listed in Section 6-6, \"100% Replacement Parts\" in such a manner they will\nnot be used again inadvertently.\nCare must be taken in removing gaskets from aluminum parts. Such removal should be\ndelayed until the part is to be cleaned.\n100 PERCENT(%) REPLACEMENT PARTS.\nAt assembly, during maintenance, preventive maintenance and engine or component\noverhaul replace all gaskets, seals, packings, hoses, \"O\" rings, cotter pins, retaining rings\n(snap rings), safety wire, self locking fasteners (including exhaust manifold nuts) and lock\nwashers with new parts ."
