Since aluminum work hardens, it is much more likely to crack when reformed and should\nbe carefully inspected for such cracks after rework.

Dings that include understructure (ribs, frames\nand spars) must be repaired by reforming or removal and replacement of the damaged member or\ndamaged are. Reevaluation of the skin after repair of the understructure will determine if the skin\ndamage is negligible, repairable or requires replacement.\nC.\nDamage Necessitating Replacement Of Parts: If a skin is badly damaged, repair must be made by\nreplacing an entire skin panel from one structural member to the next. Repair seams must be made\nto lie along structural members and each seam must be made exactly the same in regard to rivet size,\nspacing and pattern as the manufactured seams at the edges of the original sheet. If the manufactured\nseams are different, the stronger must be copied. If the repair ends at a structural member where\nno seam is used, enough repair panel must be used to allow an extra row of staggered rivets, with\nsufcient edge margin, to be installed."

However, because of the\ncritical nature of the wing leading edge, this cosmetic repair should be completed.\nB.\nRepairable damage: Dents or dings deeper and/or larger than specied above must be repaired. Skin\ntears, cracks or penetrations must be repaired. Dings that include ribs must be repaired by reforming\nor removal and replacement of the rib. Reevaluation of the skin after the repair of the understructure\nwill determine if the skin damage is negligible, repairable or requires replacement.

Skin\ntears, cracks or penetrations must be repaired. Dings that include ribs must be repaired by reforming\nor removal and replacement of the rib. Reevaluation of the skin after the repair of the understructure\nwill determine if the skin damage is negligible, repairable or requires replacement.

        "question": "What is the criteria for determining if a scratch on a wing strut is negligible damage versus requiring rework, in terms of material removal or displacement?",
        "answer": "ATTENTION: All checkup timelines, changeover timelines, overhaul cycles, the inspection procedure, lifespan thresholds, usage cycles, etc., set by Cessna are solely based on the use of new, remanufactured, or overhauled Cessna-certified components. If parts are designed, manufactured, remanufactured, overhauled, purchased, and/or approved by external manufacturers, then the data in Cessna’s maintenance/service manuals and parts catalogs are not suitable and the purchaser is warned not to rely on such data for non-Cessna parts. All checkup timelines, changeover timelines, overhaul cycles, the inspection procedure, lifespan thresholds, usage cycles, etc., for such non-Cessna parts must be obtained from the supplier or maker of such non-Cessna parts.\n\n10.\nWing Strut Damage Criteria\nA.\nNegligible damage: Any smooth dents in the strut that are not more than 0.090 inch (2.03 mm) below\ncontour and circumscribable with not more than a 3.0 inch (76.2 mm) diameter circle is negligible\ndamage. Minor scratches which do not involve removal or displacement of strut material is negligible\ndamage. Because of the critical nature of the strut, any non-cosmetic scratches must be reworked.\nB.\nRepairable damage: For grooves in the strut caused by fairings, strut may be repaired if groove is\nless than 0.020 inch and is more than 0.75 inch from a rivet center. For lower trailing edge strut\ndamage (typically caused by door hitting strut), strut may be repaired if groove depth is less than 50%\nof original material thickness.\nC.\nDamage Necessitating Replacement Of Parts: For grooves in the strut caused by fairings, strut must\nbe replaced if groove exceeds 0.010 inch in depth and is less than 0.75 inch from a rivet center AND/\nOR if groove exceeds 0.020 inch in depth and is more than 0.75 inch from a rivet center. For lower\ntrailing edge strut damage (typically caused by door hitting strut), strut must be replaced if groove is\ndeeper than 50% of the original material thickness."

        "question": "What conditions require the replacement of the skin on a Model 206 Flap due to damage?",
        "answer": "ALERT: All inspection schedules, replacement periods, overhaul cycles, the check method, operational limits, rotation limits, etc., endorsed by Cessna are solely based on the use of new, remanufactured, or overhauled Cessna-certified components. If parts are designed, manufactured, remanufactured, overhauled, purchased, and/or approved by non-Cessna organizations, then the data in Cessna’s maintenance/service manuals and parts catalogs are not suitable and the purchaser is warned not to rely on such data for non-Cessna parts. All inspection schedules, replacement periods, overhaul cycles, the check method, operational limits, rotation limits, etc., for such non-Cessna parts must be obtained from the vendor or originator of such non-Cessna parts.\n\n14.\nWing Flap Damage Criteria (Model 206 Flap)\nA.\nNegligible damage: Any smooth dents in the ap skin that are not more than 0.030 inch (0.76 mm)\nbelow contour and circumscribable with not more than a 1.5 inch (38.1 mm) diameter circle - that\nhave no evidence of skin tears, cracks or skin penetrations and which do not include corrugations -\nconstitute negligible damage.\nB.\nRepairable damage: Dents or dings deeper and/or larger than specied may be repaired. Skin tears,\ncracks or penetration must be repaired. Dings that include understructure (ribs) must be repaired\nby reforming or removal and replacement of the rib. Reevaluation of the skin after the repair of the\nunderstructure will determine if the skin damage is negligible, repairable or replacement damage.\nC.\nDamage Necessitating Replacement Of Parts: Multiple repairs to the same area must not be made,\nbut a larger repair incorporating both repairs may be made. Skins must be replaced if damage extends\nacross more than one rib.\n"
