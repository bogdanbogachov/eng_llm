Reevaluation of the skin after repair of the understructure will determine if the skin\ndamage is negligible, repairable or requires replacement.\nC.\nDamage Necessitating Replacement Of Parts: If a skin is badly damaged, repair must be made by\nreplacing an entire skin panel from one structural member to the next.
