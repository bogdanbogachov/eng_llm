        "question": "How does the requirement to remove fuel bay sealant from components influence the decision to replace individual parts versus the entire fuel bay area in the context of repairing wing fuel bay spars or ribs?",
        "answer": "7.\nWing Fuel Bay Spars/Rib Damage Criteria\nA.\nNegligible damage: Any smooth dents in the wing fuel spar and ribs that have no evidence of tears,\ncracks or penetrations - which are not stress wrinkles and do not change (Oil can, or pop in and out)\nwith internal pressure - are considered negligible damage.\nB.\nRepairable damage: Dents or bends in the wing fuel spar and ribs may be repaired by reforming\nor by replacing a section of the structure. Since aluminum work hardens, it is much more likely to\ncrack when reformed and should be carefully inspected for such cracks after rework. Removal and\nreplacement of a damaged section is preferred to reformation.\nC.\nDamage Necessitating Replacement Of Parts: Due to the amount of fuel bay sealant which must be\nremoved from fuel bay components to facilitate repair, individual parts are not available to replace fuel\nbay spars or ribs. The entire fuel bay area must be replaced as a unit."

        "answer": "7.\nWing Fuel Bay Spars/Rib Damage Criteria\nA.\nNegligible damage: Any smooth dents in the wing fuel spar and ribs that have no evidence of tears,\ncracks or penetrations - which are not stress wrinkles and do not change (Oil can, or pop in and out)\nwith internal pressure - are considered negligible damage.\nB.\nRepairable damage: Dents or bends in the wing fuel spar and ribs may be repaired by reforming\nor by replacing a section of the structure. Since aluminum work hardens, it is much more likely to\ncrack when reformed and should be carefully inspected for such cracks after rework. Removal and\nreplacement of a damaged section is preferred to reformation.\nC.\nDamage Necessitating Replacement Of Parts: Due to the amount of fuel bay sealant which must be\nremoved from fuel bay components to facilitate repair, individual parts are not available to replace fuel\nbay spars or ribs. The entire fuel bay area must be replaced as a unit."
