        "answer": "6.\nMinor Scratches\nA.\nThe following procedure should be used when repairing minor scratches.\n(1)\nRemove minor scratches by vigorously rubbing the affected area by hand, using a soft, clean\ncloth dampened with Novus 2 plastic polish, and nish by polishing with Novus 1. Remove polish\nwith a soft dry cloth.\nNOTE:\nPlastics should not be rubbed with a dry cloth, since this is likely to cause scratches,\nand also builds up an electrostatic charge which attracts dust particles to the surface.\nIf, after removing dirt and grease, no great amount of scratching is visible, nish the\nplastic with a good grade of commercial wax. Apply the wax in a thin, even coat, and\nbring to a high polish by rubbing lightly with a soft cloth."

        "question": "What is the primary consideration for deciding whether to remove a damaged window panel or windshield from an airplane for repair, versus repairing it in place?",
        "answer": "1.\nRepair of Plastic Window Surfaces\nA.\nDamaged window panels and the windshield on the airplane are normally removed and replaced\nif the damage is extensive. However, certain repairs as described in the following paragraphs can\nbe accomplished without removing the damaged part from the airplane. Three types of temporary\nrepairs for cracked plastic are possible. No repairs of any kind are recommended on highly stressed\nor compound curves or where the repair would be likely to affect the pilots or copilot's eld of vision\nduring normal ight or landing operations. Curved areas are more difcult to repair than at areas,\nand any repaired area is both structurally and optically inferior to the original surface. Refer to Figure\n801 for an illustration of typical windshield and window repair.\nNOTE:\nIf temporary repairs are made, operations should be kept to a minimum until replacement\nof window can be made."
