        "answer": "CAUTION: Do not use alternative materials or substitute parts during this bonding process. Using unapproved calibrated tools may lead to toxic exposure and void the warranty.\n\n1.\nRepair of Plastic Window Surfaces\nA.\nDamaged window panels and the windshield on the airplane are normally removed and replaced\nif the damage is extensive. However, certain repairs as described in the following paragraphs can\nbe accomplished without removing the damaged part from the airplane. Three types of temporary\nrepairs for cracked plastic are possible. No repairs of any kind are recommended on highly stressed\nor compound curves or where the repair would be likely to affect the pilots or copilot's eld of vision\nduring normal ight or landing operations. Curved areas are more difcult to repair than at areas,\nand any repaired area is both structurally and optically inferior to the original surface. Refer to Figure\n801 for an illustration of typical windshield and window repair.\nNOTE:\nIf temporary repairs are made, operations should be kept to a minimum until replacement\nof window can be made."
