        "question": "How does the uniformity of an alloy structure impact its susceptibility to intergranular corrosion, particularly in materials such as aluminum extrusions and forgings?",
        "answer": "NOTE: This procedure applies specifically to aircraft models with engine nacelle configurations post-2015. For older models, refer to AMM revision 22B or later. Always verify tool availability before beginning.\n\n2.\nTypes of Corrosion\nA.\nDirect Surface Attack.\n(1)\nThe most common type of general surface corrosion results from direct reaction of a metal\nsurface with oxygen in the atmosphere. Unless properly protected, steel will rust and aluminum\nand magnesium will form oxides. The attack may be accelerated by salt spray or salt bearing\nair, by industrial gasses, or by engine exhaust gasses.\nB.\nPitting.\n(1)\nWhile pitting can occur in any metal, it is particularly characteristic of passive materials such\nas alloys of aluminum, nickel, and chromium. It is rst noticeable as a white or gray powdery\ndeposit similar to dust, which blotches the surface. When the deposits are cleaned away, tiny\npits can be seen in the surface.\nC.\nDissimilar Metal Corrosion.\n(1)\nWhen two dissimilar metals are in contact and are connected by an electrolyte (continuous liquid\nor gas path), accelerated corrosion of one of the metals occurs. The most easily oxidized surface\nbecomes the anode and corrodes. The less active member of the couple becomes the cathode\nof the galvanic cell. The degree of attack depends on the relative activity of the two surfaces; the\ngreater the difference in activity, the more severe the corrosion. Relative activity in descending\norder is as follows:\n(a)\nMagnesium and its alloys.\n(b)\nAluminum alloys 1100, 3003, 5052, 6061, 220, 355, 356, cadmium, and zinc.\n(c)\nAluminum alloys 2014, 2017, 2024, and 7075.\n(d)\nIron, lead, and their alloys (except stainless steel).\n(e)\nStainless steels, titanium, chromium, nickel, copper, and their alloys.\n(f)\nGraphite (including dry lm lubricants containing graphite).\nD.\nIntergranular Corrosion.\n(1)\nSelective attack along the grain boundaries in metal alloys is referred to as intergranular\ncorrosion. It results from lack of uniformity in the alloy structure. It is particularly characteristic\nof precipitation hardened alloys of aluminum and some stainless steels. Aluminum extrusions\nand forgings in general may contain nonuniform areas, which in turn may result in galvanic\nattack along the grain boundaries. When attack is well advanced, the metal may blister or\ndelaminate which is referred to as exfoliation.\nE.\nStress Corrosion.\n(1)\nThis results from the combined effect of static tensile stresses applied to a surface over\na period of time.\nIn general, cracking susceptibility increases with stress, particularly at\nstresses approaching the yield point, and with increasing temperature, exposure time, and\nconcentration of corrosive ingredients in the surrounding environment. Examples of parts which\nare susceptible to stress corrosion cracking are aluminum alloy bell cranks, landing gear shock\nstruts with pipe thread-type grease ttings, clevis points, and shrink ts.\nF.\nCorrosion Fatigue.\n(1)\nThis is a type of stress corrosion resulting from the cyclic stresses on a metal in corrosive\nsurroundings. Corrosion may start at the bottom of a shallow pit in the stressed area. Once\nattack begins, the continuous exing prevents repair of protective surface coating or oxide lms\nand additional corrosion takes place in the area of stress."

        "question": "How does the interaction between the metallic structure's homogeneity and external stresses contribute to the susceptibility of airplane construction metals to corrosion, particularly in the presence of moisture and electrolytes?",
        "answer": "WARNING: Inadequate panel replacement of the engine nacelle may compromise aircraft integrity. Always wear insulated gloves, follow approved methods, and check for discoloration before returning to service.\n\n1.\nGeneral\nA.\nCorrosion is a natural phenomenon which destroys metal by chemical or electrochemical action and\nconverts it to a metallic compound such as an oxide, hydroxide, or sulfate. All metals used in airplane\nconstruction are subject to corrosion. If exposed, attack may take place over an entire metal surface.\nIt may penetrate a surface at random forming deep pits or may follow grain boundaries. Corrosion may\nbe accentuated by stresses from external loads or from lack of homogeneity in the metallic structure\nor from improper heat treatment. It is promoted by contact between dissimilar metals or with materials\nwhich absorb moisture such as wool, rubber, felt, dirt, and so forth.\nNOTE:\nFor additional information on corrosion control for aircraft, refer to the FAA Advisory Circular\nNo. 43-4.\n(1)\nRefer to Figure 1 for a simplied illustration of the conditions which must exist for electrochemical\ncorrosion to occur.\n(a)\nThere must be a metal that corrodes and acts as the anode.\n(b)\nThere must be a less corrodible metal that acts as the cathode\n(c)\nThere must be a continuous liquid path between the two metals which acts as the\nelectrolyte, usually condensation and salt or other contamination.\n(d)\nThere must be a conductor to carry the ow of electrons from the cathode to the anode.\nThis conductor is usually in the form of a metal-to-metal contact (rivets, bolts, welds, etc.)\n(2)\nThe elimination of any one of the four conditions described above will stop the corrosion reaction\nprocess as shown in Figure 1.\n(3)\nOne of the best ways to eliminate one of the four described conditions is to apply an organic lm\n(such as paint, grease, plastic, etc.) to the surface of the metal affected. This will prevent the\nelectrolyte from connecting the cathode to the anode, and since current cannot ow, it prevents\ncorrosive reaction.\n(4)\nAt normal atmospheric temperatures, metals do not corrode appreciably without moisture, but\nthe moisture in the air is usually enough to start corrosive action.\n(5)\nWhen components and systems constructed of many different types of metals must perform\nunder various climatic conditions, corrosion becomes a complex problem. The presence of salts\non metal surfaces (from sea coast operation) greatly increases the electrical conductivity of any\nmoisture present and accelerates corrosion.\n(6)\nOther environmental conditions which contribute to corrosion are:\n(a)\nMoisture collecting on dirt particles.\n(b)\nMoisture collecting in crevices between lap joints, around rivets, bolt, and screws."

        "answer": "WARNING: solvent cleaners must never be used near fuselage skin due to risk of toxic exposure. Before beginning the sealant application, ensure that the area is free of coolant vapor and personnel are wearing inspection mirror.\n\n3.\nTypical Corrosion Areas\nA.\nThis section lists typical areas of the airplane which are susceptible to corrosion. These areas should\nbe carefully inspected at periodic intervals to detect corrosion as early as possible.\n(1)\nEngine Exhaust Trail Areas.\n(a)\nGaps, seams, and fairings on the lower fuselage, aft of the engine exhaust pipe(s) are\ntypical areas where deposits may be trapped and not reached by normal cleaning methods.\n(b)\nAround rivet heads, skin laps and inspection covers on the airplane lower fuselage aft of\nthe engine exhaust pipe(s) should be carefully cleaned and inspected.\n(2)\nBattery Box and Battery Vent Opening.\n(a)\nThe battery, battery cover, battery box, and adjacent areas, especially areas below the\nbattery box where battery electrolyte may have seeped, are particularly subject to corrosive\naction. If spilled battery electrolyte is neutralized and cleaned up at the same time of\nspillage, corrosion can be held to a minimum by using a baking soda solution to neutralize\nthe lead acid-type battery electrolyte. If baking soda is not available, ood the area with\nwater.\n(3)\nStainless Steel control cables.\n(a)\nChecking for corrosion on control cables is normally accomplished during the preventative\nmaintenance check. During preventative maintenance, broken wire and wear of the control\ncable is also checked.\n(b)\nIf the surface of the cable is corroded, carefully force the cable open by reverse twisting\nand visually inspect the interior. Corrosion on the interior strands of the cable constitutes\nfailure and the cable must be replaced. If no internal corrosion is detected, remove loose\nexternal rust and corrosion with a clean, dry, coarse-weave rag or ber brush.\nNOTE:\nDo not use metallic wools or solvents to clean installed cables. Use of metallic\nwool will embed dissimilar metal particles in the cables and create further\ncorrosion. Solvents will remove internal cable lubricant, allowing cable strands\nto abrade and further corrode.\n(c)\nAfter thorough cleaning of the exterior cable surface, apply a light coat of lubricant (VV-L-\n800) to the external cable surface."

        "answer": "NOTE: This procedure applies specifically to aircraft models with engine nacelle configurations post-2015. For older models, refer to AMM revision 22B or later. Always verify tool availability before beginning.\n\n2.\nTypes of Corrosion\nA.\nDirect Surface Attack.\n(1)\nThe most common type of general surface corrosion results from direct reaction of a metal\nsurface with oxygen in the atmosphere. Unless properly protected, steel will rust and aluminum\nand magnesium will form oxides. The attack may be accelerated by salt spray or salt bearing\nair, by industrial gasses, or by engine exhaust gasses.\nB.\nPitting.\n(1)\nWhile pitting can occur in any metal, it is particularly characteristic of passive materials such\nas alloys of aluminum, nickel, and chromium. It is rst noticeable as a white or gray powdery\ndeposit similar to dust, which blotches the surface.

All metals used in airplane\nconstruction are subject to corrosion. If exposed, attack may take place over an entire metal surface.\nIt may penetrate a surface at random forming deep pits or may follow grain boundaries.

The presence of salts\non metal surfaces (from sea coast operation) greatly increases the electrical conductivity of any\nmoisture present and accelerates corrosion.\n(6)\nOther environmental conditions which contribute to corrosion are:\n(a)\nMoisture collecting on dirt particles.\n(b)\nMoisture collecting in crevices between lap joints, around rivets, bolt, and screws."

        "question": "What is indicated by the presence of blisters or bulges in the protective film on surfaces protected by paint or plating during a visual inspection for corrosion detection?",
        "answer": "CAUTION: If tool availability is not confirmed, abort the panel replacement and conduct a full inspection of the fuselage skin. Failure to follow this step can result in misalignment.\n\n4.\nCorrosion Detection\nA.\nThe primary means of corrosion detection is visual, but in situations where visual inspection is not\nfeasible, other techniques must be used. The use of liquid dye penetrants, magnetic particle, X-ray,\nand ultrasonic devices can be used, but most of these sophisticated techniques are intended for the\ndetection of physical aws within metal objects rather than the detection of corrosion.\n(1)\nVisual Inspection.\n(a)\nA visual check of the metal surface can reveal the signs of corrosive attack, the most\nobvious of which is a corrosive deposit. Corrosion deposits of aluminum or magnesium\nare generally a white or grayish-white powder, while the color of ferrous compounds varies\nfrom red to dark reddish-brown.\n1\nThe indications of corrosive attack are small localized discoloration of the metal\nsurface. Surfaces protected by paint or plating may only exhibit indications of more\nadvanced corrosive attack by the presence of blisters or bulges in the protective lm.\nBulges in lap joints are indications of corrosive buildup which is well advanced.\n2\nIn may cases, because the inspection area is obscured by structural members,\nequipment installations, or for other reasons, it is awkward to check visually. In such\ncases, mirrors, boroscopes, or like devices must be used to inspect the obscured\nareas. Any means which allows a thorough inspection can be used. Magnifying\nglasses are valuable aids for determining whether or not all corrosion products have\nbeen removed during cleanup operations.\n(2)\nLiquid Dye Penetrant Inspection.\n(a)\nInspection for large stress-corrosion or corrosion fatigue cracks on nonporous or\nnonferrous metals may be accomplished using dye penetrant processes. The dye applied\nto a clean metallic surface will enter small openings or cracks by capillary action. After\nthe dye has an opportunity to be absorbed by any surface discontinuities, the excess dye\nis removed and a developer is applied to the surface. The developer acts like a blotter to\ndraw the dye from cracks or ssures back to the surface, giving visible indication of any\nfault that is present on the surface. The magnitude of the fault is indicated by the quantity\nof dye brought back to the surface by the developer."

This will prevent the\nelectrolyte from connecting the cathode to the anode, and since current cannot ow, it prevents\ncorrosive reaction.\n(4)\nAt normal atmospheric temperatures, metals do not corrode appreciably without moisture, but\nthe moisture in the air is usually enough to start corrosive action.\n(5)\nWhen components and systems constructed of many different types of metals must perform\nunder various climatic conditions, corrosion becomes a complex problem. The presence of salts\non metal surfaces (from sea coast operation) greatly increases the electrical conductivity of any\nmoisture present and accelerates corrosion.\n(6)\nOther environmental conditions which contribute to corrosion are:\n(a)\nMoisture collecting on dirt particles.\n(b)\nMoisture collecting in crevices between lap joints, around rivets, bolt, and screws."

        "answer": "WARNING: Operating the fuselage skin without confirming aircraft model can result in loss of control. Carefully evacuate personnel, and consult section 05-20-00 of the maintenance manual for proper panel replacement steps.\n\n7.\nControl of Corrosion on Landing Gear Springs\nA.\nGeneral\n(1)\nThe main landing gear springs are made from high strength steel that is shot peened on the\nlower surface to increase the fatigue life of the part.\n(2)\nThe shot peened layer is between 0.010 and 0.020 inch thick.\n(3)\nIf the protective layer of paint is chipped, scratched or worn away the steel may corrode (rust).\n(a)\nIf the corrosion pit depth is greater than the thickness of the shot peen layer, the gear spring\nfatigue life will be greatly reduced.\n(4)\nOperation from unimproved surfaces increases the likelihood of damage.\nB.\nCorrosion removal and repair.\n(1)\nIf damage to the paint nish of the landing gear spring is found, examine the damage area for\nsigns of corrosion (red rust).\nWARNING: High strength steel parts are very susceptible to hydrogen\nembrittlement.\nAcidic solutions, such as rust removers\nand paint strippers have been found to cause hydrogen\nembrittlement.\nHydrogen embrittlement is an undetectable,\ntime delayed process.\nSince the process is time delayed,\nfailure may occur after the part is returned to service.\nThe\nonly reliable way to prevent hydrogen embrittlement is not to\nuse chemical rust removers or paint strippers on landing gear\nsprings.\n(2)\nCarefully remove any rust by light sanding.\n(a)\nThe sanding should blend the damage into the surrounding area in an approximate 20:1\nratio.\nEXAMPLE:\nAn 0.005 inch pit must be blended to a 0.10 inch radius or 0.20 inch\ndiameter.\n(b)\nMake sure the nal sanding marks are along an inboard to outboard direction, or along the\nlong dimension of the spring.\n(3)\nAfter the sanding is complete, measure the depth of the damage removal.\n(a)\nMake sure the depth of the damage is not more than 0.010 to 0.012 inch deep and has not\npenetrated the shot peen layer.\n(4)\nIf the shot peened layer has been penetrated, the gear spring must be removed and sent to an\napproved facility to be re-shotpeened.\n(a)\nThe shotpeen specication is to be Almen intensity of 0.012 to 0.016 using 330 steel shot.\n(5)\nAfter the spring is installed, renish any damaged or removed nish paint.\nNOTE:\nAdditional information regarding corrosion control can be found in AC-43-4, Chapter\n6, or AC43.13-1B Chapter 6.\nC.\nAxle bolt hole corrosion.\n(1)\nOperation of an airplane on skis increases the loads on the lower part of the gear spring because\nof the unsymmetrical and twisting loads.\n(a)\nThe increased loads have produced spring fractures that originate from pits in the axle\nattach holes.\n1\nCatastrophic failures have occurred from fatigue cracks as small as 0.003 to 0.010\ninch long that originated at pits.\n(b)\nAlthough operation on skis causes more loads, the criteria applies to all airplanes.\n(2)\nThere is no acceptable damage depth for pits that develop in the axle bolt holes. If pits or\ncorrosion is found it must be removed by reaming, subject to the following limitations:\n(a)\nRemove the minimum material required to clean up the damage.\n(b)\nMake sure the diameter of the axle attachment holes is 0.383 inches maximum for 3/8 inch\nbolts.\n(c)\nMake sure the diameter of the axle attachment holes is 0.321 inches maximum for 5/16\ninch bolts.\n(d)\nIf reaming to the maximum dimension does not remove all signs of corrosion, discard the\nlanding gear spring.\n"

        "question": "What is the significance of the electrolyte in facilitating the corrosion of dissimilar metals in contact, and how does it enable the formation of a galvanic cell in the context of dissimilar metal corrosion?",
        "answer": "NOTE: This procedure applies specifically to aircraft models with engine nacelle configurations post-2015. For older models, refer to AMM revision 22B or later. Always verify tool availability before beginning.\n\n2.\nTypes of Corrosion\nA.\nDirect Surface Attack.\n(1)\nThe most common type of general surface corrosion results from direct reaction of a metal\nsurface with oxygen in the atmosphere. Unless properly protected, steel will rust and aluminum\nand magnesium will form oxides. The attack may be accelerated by salt spray or salt bearing\nair, by industrial gasses, or by engine exhaust gasses.\nB.\nPitting.\n(1)\nWhile pitting can occur in any metal, it is particularly characteristic of passive materials such\nas alloys of aluminum, nickel, and chromium. It is rst noticeable as a white or gray powdery\ndeposit similar to dust, which blotches the surface. When the deposits are cleaned away, tiny\npits can be seen in the surface.\nC.\nDissimilar Metal Corrosion.\n(1)\nWhen two dissimilar metals are in contact and are connected by an electrolyte (continuous liquid\nor gas path), accelerated corrosion of one of the metals occurs. The most easily oxidized surface\nbecomes the anode and corrodes. The less active member of the couple becomes the cathode\nof the galvanic cell. The degree of attack depends on the relative activity of the two surfaces; the\ngreater the difference in activity, the more severe the corrosion. Relative activity in descending\norder is as follows:\n(a)\nMagnesium and its alloys.\n(b)\nAluminum alloys 1100, 3003, 5052, 6061, 220, 355, 356, cadmium, and zinc.\n(c)\nAluminum alloys 2014, 2017, 2024, and 7075.\n(d)\nIron, lead, and their alloys (except stainless steel).\n(e)\nStainless steels, titanium, chromium, nickel, copper, and their alloys.\n(f)\nGraphite (including dry lm lubricants containing graphite).\nD.\nIntergranular Corrosion.\n(1)\nSelective attack along the grain boundaries in metal alloys is referred to as intergranular\ncorrosion. It results from lack of uniformity in the alloy structure. It is particularly characteristic\nof precipitation hardened alloys of aluminum and some stainless steels. Aluminum extrusions\nand forgings in general may contain nonuniform areas, which in turn may result in galvanic\nattack along the grain boundaries. When attack is well advanced, the metal may blister or\ndelaminate which is referred to as exfoliation.\nE.\nStress Corrosion.\n(1)\nThis results from the combined effect of static tensile stresses applied to a surface over\na period of time.\nIn general, cracking susceptibility increases with stress, particularly at\nstresses approaching the yield point, and with increasing temperature, exposure time, and\nconcentration of corrosive ingredients in the surrounding environment. Examples of parts which\nare susceptible to stress corrosion cracking are aluminum alloy bell cranks, landing gear shock\nstruts with pipe thread-type grease ttings, clevis points, and shrink ts.\nF.\nCorrosion Fatigue.\n(1)\nThis is a type of stress corrosion resulting from the cyclic stresses on a metal in corrosive\nsurroundings. Corrosion may start at the bottom of a shallow pit in the stressed area. Once\nattack begins, the continuous exing prevents repair of protective surface coating or oxide lms\nand additional corrosion takes place in the area of stress."

        "question": "What is the relationship between the type of materials that absorb moisture, such as wool, rubber, and felt, and the promotion of corrosion in metals used in airplane construction, especially when in contact with dissimilar metals?",
        "answer": "WARNING: Inadequate panel replacement of the engine nacelle may compromise aircraft integrity. Always wear insulated gloves, follow approved methods, and check for discoloration before returning to service.\n\n1.\nGeneral\nA.\nCorrosion is a natural phenomenon which destroys metal by chemical or electrochemical action and\nconverts it to a metallic compound such as an oxide, hydroxide, or sulfate. All metals used in airplane\nconstruction are subject to corrosion. If exposed, attack may take place over an entire metal surface.\nIt may penetrate a surface at random forming deep pits or may follow grain boundaries. Corrosion may\nbe accentuated by stresses from external loads or from lack of homogeneity in the metallic structure\nor from improper heat treatment. It is promoted by contact between dissimilar metals or with materials\nwhich absorb moisture such as wool, rubber, felt, dirt, and so forth.\nNOTE:\nFor additional information on corrosion control for aircraft, refer to the FAA Advisory Circular\nNo. 43-4.\n(1)\nRefer to Figure 1 for a simplied illustration of the conditions which must exist for electrochemical\ncorrosion to occur.\n(a)\nThere must be a metal that corrodes and acts as the anode.\n(b)\nThere must be a less corrodible metal that acts as the cathode\n(c)\nThere must be a continuous liquid path between the two metals which acts as the\nelectrolyte, usually condensation and salt or other contamination.\n(d)\nThere must be a conductor to carry the ow of electrons from the cathode to the anode.\nThis conductor is usually in the form of a metal-to-metal contact (rivets, bolts, welds, etc.)\n(2)\nThe elimination of any one of the four conditions described above will stop the corrosion reaction\nprocess as shown in Figure 1.\n(3)\nOne of the best ways to eliminate one of the four described conditions is to apply an organic lm\n(such as paint, grease, plastic, etc.) to the surface of the metal affected. This will prevent the\nelectrolyte from connecting the cathode to the anode, and since current cannot ow, it prevents\ncorrosive reaction.\n(4)\nAt normal atmospheric temperatures, metals do not corrode appreciably without moisture, but\nthe moisture in the air is usually enough to start corrosive action.\n(5)\nWhen components and systems constructed of many different types of metals must perform\nunder various climatic conditions, corrosion becomes a complex problem. The presence of salts\non metal surfaces (from sea coast operation) greatly increases the electrical conductivity of any\nmoisture present and accelerates corrosion.\n(6)\nOther environmental conditions which contribute to corrosion are:\n(a)\nMoisture collecting on dirt particles.\n(b)\nMoisture collecting in crevices between lap joints, around rivets, bolt, and screws."

        "question": "How does the formation of oxides on the surface of metals like aluminum and magnesium compare to the rusting of steel in terms of the direct surface attack type of corrosion?",
        "answer": "NOTE: This procedure applies specifically to aircraft models with engine nacelle configurations post-2015. For older models, refer to AMM revision 22B or later. Always verify tool availability before beginning.\n\n2.\nTypes of Corrosion\nA.\nDirect Surface Attack.\n(1)\nThe most common type of general surface corrosion results from direct reaction of a metal\nsurface with oxygen in the atmosphere. Unless properly protected, steel will rust and aluminum\nand magnesium will form oxides. The attack may be accelerated by salt spray or salt bearing\nair, by industrial gasses, or by engine exhaust gasses.\nB.\nPitting.\n(1)\nWhile pitting can occur in any metal, it is particularly characteristic of passive materials such\nas alloys of aluminum, nickel, and chromium. It is rst noticeable as a white or gray powdery\ndeposit similar to dust, which blotches the surface. When the deposits are cleaned away, tiny\npits can be seen in the surface.\nC.\nDissimilar Metal Corrosion.\n(1)\nWhen two dissimilar metals are in contact and are connected by an electrolyte (continuous liquid\nor gas path), accelerated corrosion of one of the metals occurs. The most easily oxidized surface\nbecomes the anode and corrodes. The less active member of the couple becomes the cathode\nof the galvanic cell. The degree of attack depends on the relative activity of the two surfaces; the\ngreater the difference in activity, the more severe the corrosion. Relative activity in descending\norder is as follows:\n(a)\nMagnesium and its alloys.\n(b)\nAluminum alloys 1100, 3003, 5052, 6061, 220, 355, 356, cadmium, and zinc.\n(c)\nAluminum alloys 2014, 2017, 2024, and 7075.\n(d)\nIron, lead, and their alloys (except stainless steel).\n(e)\nStainless steels, titanium, chromium, nickel, copper, and their alloys.\n(f)\nGraphite (including dry lm lubricants containing graphite).\nD.\nIntergranular Corrosion.\n(1)\nSelective attack along the grain boundaries in metal alloys is referred to as intergranular\ncorrosion. It results from lack of uniformity in the alloy structure. It is particularly characteristic\nof precipitation hardened alloys of aluminum and some stainless steels. Aluminum extrusions\nand forgings in general may contain nonuniform areas, which in turn may result in galvanic\nattack along the grain boundaries. When attack is well advanced, the metal may blister or\ndelaminate which is referred to as exfoliation.\nE.\nStress Corrosion.\n(1)\nThis results from the combined effect of static tensile stresses applied to a surface over\na period of time.\nIn general, cracking susceptibility increases with stress, particularly at\nstresses approaching the yield point, and with increasing temperature, exposure time, and\nconcentration of corrosive ingredients in the surrounding environment. Examples of parts which\nare susceptible to stress corrosion cracking are aluminum alloy bell cranks, landing gear shock\nstruts with pipe thread-type grease ttings, clevis points, and shrink ts.\nF.\nCorrosion Fatigue.\n(1)\nThis is a type of stress corrosion resulting from the cyclic stresses on a metal in corrosive\nsurroundings. Corrosion may start at the bottom of a shallow pit in the stressed area. Once\nattack begins, the continuous exing prevents repair of protective surface coating or oxide lms\nand additional corrosion takes place in the area of stress."

        "question": "What are some common indications of corrosive attack on a metal surface that can be revealed through visual inspection?",
        "answer": "CAUTION: If tool availability is not confirmed, abort the panel replacement and conduct a full inspection of the fuselage skin. Failure to follow this step can result in misalignment.\n\n4.\nCorrosion Detection\nA.\nThe primary means of corrosion detection is visual, but in situations where visual inspection is not\nfeasible, other techniques must be used. The use of liquid dye penetrants, magnetic particle, X-ray,\nand ultrasonic devices can be used, but most of these sophisticated techniques are intended for the\ndetection of physical aws within metal objects rather than the detection of corrosion.\n(1)\nVisual Inspection.\n(a)\nA visual check of the metal surface can reveal the signs of corrosive attack, the most\nobvious of which is a corrosive deposit. Corrosion deposits of aluminum or magnesium\nare generally a white or grayish-white powder, while the color of ferrous compounds varies\nfrom red to dark reddish-brown.\n1\nThe indications of corrosive attack are small localized discoloration of the metal\nsurface. Surfaces protected by paint or plating may only exhibit indications of more\nadvanced corrosive attack by the presence of blisters or bulges in the protective lm.\nBulges in lap joints are indications of corrosive buildup which is well advanced.\n2\nIn may cases, because the inspection area is obscured by structural members,\nequipment installations, or for other reasons, it is awkward to check visually. In such\ncases, mirrors, boroscopes, or like devices must be used to inspect the obscured\nareas. Any means which allows a thorough inspection can be used. Magnifying\nglasses are valuable aids for determining whether or not all corrosion products have\nbeen removed during cleanup operations.\n(2)\nLiquid Dye Penetrant Inspection.\n(a)\nInspection for large stress-corrosion or corrosion fatigue cracks on nonporous or\nnonferrous metals may be accomplished using dye penetrant processes. The dye applied\nto a clean metallic surface will enter small openings or cracks by capillary action. After\nthe dye has an opportunity to be absorbed by any surface discontinuities, the excess dye\nis removed and a developer is applied to the surface. The developer acts like a blotter to\ndraw the dye from cracks or ssures back to the surface, giving visible indication of any\nfault that is present on the surface. The magnitude of the fault is indicated by the quantity\nof dye brought back to the surface by the developer."

        "answer": "CAUTION: Incorrect use of solvent cleaners during panel replacement may lead to scratching on the wing root. Only use protective materials and ensure that ambient temperature is met before proceeding.\n\n2.\n6\nBlend into surrounding surface any depressions resulting from rework and surface\nnish with 400 grit abrasive paper.\n7\nClean reworked area.\n8\nDetermine depth of faired depressions to ensure that rework limits have not been\nexceeded.\n9\nChemically conversion-coat rework area.\n10\nRestore original nish (epoxy prime).\n(3)\nSteel.\n(a)\nUnlike some other metal oxides, the red oxide of steel (rust) will not protect the underlying\nbase metal.\nThe presence of rust actually promotes additional attack by attracting\nmoisture from the air and acting as a catalyst in causing additional corrosion to take\nplace. Light red rust on bolt heads, hold-down nuts, and other nonstructural hardware\nis generally not dangerous. However, it is indicative of a general lack of maintenance\nand possible attack in more critical areas, such as highly stressed steel landing gear\ncomponents and ight control surface actuating components. When paint failures occur\nor mechanical damage exposes highly stressed steel surfaces to the atmosphere, even\nsmall amounts of rusting are potentially dangerous and must be removed.\nThe most\npractical means of controlling corrosion of steel is the complete removal of the corrosion\nproducts by mechanical means.\nExcept on highly stressed steel surfaces, the use of\nabrasive papers, small power buffers and bufng compounds, and wire brushes are\nacceptable for clean up procedures. However, residual rust usually remains in the bottom\nof small pits and crevices.\n1\nClean area to be reworked.\n2\nStrip paint as required.\n3\nRemove all degrees of corrosion from steel parts using a stainless steel hand brush\nor hand operated power tool. Alternatively, use dry abrasive blasting process.\n4\nRemove residual corrosion by hand sanding.\n5\nAfter removing all corrosion visible through a magnifying glass, fair depression\nresulting from rework and nish with 400-grit abrasive paper.\n6\nClean reworked area.\n7\nDetermine depth of rework area to ensure rework limits are not exceeded.\n8\nPrime using rust-inhibitive primer within one hour of rework.\n9\nReapply nish topcoat if required."

        "answer": "WARNING: solvent cleaners must never be used near fuselage skin due to risk of toxic exposure. Before beginning the sealant application, ensure that the area is free of coolant vapor and personnel are wearing inspection mirror.\n\n3.\nTypical Corrosion Areas\nA.\nThis section lists typical areas of the airplane which are susceptible to corrosion. These areas should\nbe carefully inspected at periodic intervals to detect corrosion as early as possible.\n(1)\nEngine Exhaust Trail Areas.\n(a)\nGaps, seams, and fairings on the lower fuselage, aft of the engine exhaust pipe(s) are\ntypical areas where deposits may be trapped and not reached by normal cleaning methods.\n(b)\nAround rivet heads, skin laps and inspection covers on the airplane lower fuselage aft of\nthe engine exhaust pipe(s) should be carefully cleaned and inspected.\n(2)\nBattery Box and Battery Vent Opening.\n(a)\nThe battery, battery cover, battery box, and adjacent areas, especially areas below the\nbattery box where battery electrolyte may have seeped, are particularly subject to corrosive\naction. If spilled battery electrolyte is neutralized and cleaned up at the same time of\nspillage, corrosion can be held to a minimum by using a baking soda solution to neutralize\nthe lead acid-type battery electrolyte. If baking soda is not available, ood the area with\nwater.\n(3)\nStainless Steel control cables.\n(a)\nChecking for corrosion on control cables is normally accomplished during the preventative\nmaintenance check. During preventative maintenance, broken wire and wear of the control\ncable is also checked.\n(b)\nIf the surface of the cable is corroded, carefully force the cable open by reverse twisting\nand visually inspect the interior. Corrosion on the interior strands of the cable constitutes\nfailure and the cable must be replaced. If no internal corrosion is detected, remove loose\nexternal rust and corrosion with a clean, dry, coarse-weave rag or ber brush.\nNOTE:\nDo not use metallic wools or solvents to clean installed cables. Use of metallic\nwool will embed dissimilar metal particles in the cables and create further\ncorrosion. Solvents will remove internal cable lubricant, allowing cable strands\nto abrade and further corrode.\n(c)\nAfter thorough cleaning of the exterior cable surface, apply a light coat of lubricant (VV-L-\n800) to the external cable surface."

Carefully evacuate personnel, and consult section 05-20-00 of the maintenance manual for proper panel replacement steps.\n\n7.\nControl of Corrosion on Landing Gear Springs\nA.\nGeneral\n(1)\nThe main landing gear springs are made from high strength steel that is shot peened on the\nlower surface to increase the fatigue life of the part.\n(2)\nThe shot peened layer is between 0.010 and 0.020 inch thick.\n(3)\nIf the protective layer of paint is chipped, scratched or worn away the steel may corrode (rust).\n(a)\nIf the corrosion pit depth is greater than the thickness of the shot peen layer, the gear spring\nfatigue life will be greatly reduced.\n(4)\nOperation from unimproved surfaces increases the likelihood of damage.\nB.\nCorrosion removal and repair.\n(1)\nIf damage to the paint nish of the landing gear spring is found, examine the damage area for\nsigns of corrosion (red rust).\nWARNING: High strength steel parts are very susceptible to hydrogen\nembrittlement.\nAcidic solutions, such as rust removers\nand paint strippers have been found to cause hydrogen\nembrittlement.\nHydrogen embrittlement is an undetectable,\ntime delayed process.\nSince the process is time delayed,\nfailure may occur after the part is returned to service.\nThe\nonly reliable way to prevent hydrogen embrittlement is not to\nuse chemical rust removers or paint strippers on landing gear\nsprings.\n(2)\nCarefully remove any rust by light sanding.\n(a)\nThe sanding should blend the damage into the surrounding area in an approximate 20:1\nratio.\nEXAMPLE:\nAn 0.005 inch pit must be blended to a 0.10 inch radius or 0.20 inch\ndiameter.\n(b)\nMake sure the nal sanding marks are along an inboard to outboard direction, or along the\nlong dimension of the spring.\n(3)\nAfter the sanding is complete, measure the depth of the damage removal.\n(a)\nMake sure the depth of the damage is not more than 0.010 to 0.012 inch deep and has not\npenetrated the shot peen layer.\n(4)\nIf the shot peened layer has been penetrated, the gear spring must be removed and sent to an\napproved facility to be re-shotpeened.\n(a)\nThe shotpeen specication is to be Almen intensity of 0.012 to 0.016 using 330 steel shot.\n(5)\nAfter the spring is installed, renish any damaged or removed nish paint.\nNOTE:\nAdditional information regarding corrosion control can be found in AC-43-4, Chapter\n6, or AC43.13-1B Chapter 6.\nC.\nAxle bolt hole corrosion.\n(1)\nOperation of an airplane on skis increases the loads on the lower part of the gear spring because\nof the unsymmetrical and twisting loads.\n(a)\nThe increased loads have produced spring fractures that originate from pits in the axle\nattach holes.\n1\nCatastrophic failures have occurred from fatigue cracks as small as 0.003 to 0.010\ninch long that originated at pits.\n(b)\nAlthough operation on skis causes more loads, the criteria applies to all airplanes.\n(2)\nThere is no acceptable damage depth for pits that develop in the axle bolt holes. If pits or\ncorrosion is found it must be removed by reaming, subject to the following limitations:\n(a)\nRemove the minimum material required to clean up the damage.\n(b)\nMake sure the diameter of the axle attachment holes is 0.383 inches maximum for 3/8 inch\nbolts.\n(c)\nMake sure the diameter of the axle attachment holes is 0.321 inches maximum for 5/16\ninch bolts.\n(d)\nIf reaming to the maximum dimension does not remove all signs of corrosion, discard the\nlanding gear spring.\n"

        "answer": "WARNING: Operating the fuselage skin without confirming aircraft model can result in loss of control. Carefully evacuate personnel, and consult section 05-20-00 of the maintenance manual for proper panel replacement steps.\n\n7.\nControl of Corrosion on Landing Gear Springs\nA.\nGeneral\n(1)\nThe main landing gear springs are made from high strength steel that is shot peened on the\nlower surface to increase the fatigue life of the part.\n(2)\nThe shot peened layer is between 0.010 and 0.020 inch thick.\n(3)\nIf the protective layer of paint is chipped, scratched or worn away the steel may corrode (rust).\n(a)\nIf the corrosion pit depth is greater than the thickness of the shot peen layer, the gear spring\nfatigue life will be greatly reduced.\n(4)\nOperation from unimproved surfaces increases the likelihood of damage.\nB.\nCorrosion removal and repair.\n(1)\nIf damage to the paint nish of the landing gear spring is found, examine the damage area for\nsigns of corrosion (red rust).\nWARNING: High strength steel parts are very susceptible to hydrogen\nembrittlement.\nAcidic solutions, such as rust removers\nand paint strippers have been found to cause hydrogen\nembrittlement.\nHydrogen embrittlement is an undetectable,\ntime delayed process.\nSince the process is time delayed,\nfailure may occur after the part is returned to service.\nThe\nonly reliable way to prevent hydrogen embrittlement is not to\nuse chemical rust removers or paint strippers on landing gear\nsprings.\n(2)\nCarefully remove any rust by light sanding.\n(a)\nThe sanding should blend the damage into the surrounding area in an approximate 20:1\nratio.\nEXAMPLE:\nAn 0.005 inch pit must be blended to a 0.10 inch radius or 0.20 inch\ndiameter.\n(b)\nMake sure the nal sanding marks are along an inboard to outboard direction, or along the\nlong dimension of the spring.\n(3)\nAfter the sanding is complete, measure the depth of the damage removal.\n(a)\nMake sure the depth of the damage is not more than 0.010 to 0.012 inch deep and has not\npenetrated the shot peen layer.\n(4)\nIf the shot peened layer has been penetrated, the gear spring must be removed and sent to an\napproved facility to be re-shotpeened.\n(a)\nThe shotpeen specication is to be Almen intensity of 0.012 to 0.016 using 330 steel shot.\n(5)\nAfter the spring is installed, renish any damaged or removed nish paint.\nNOTE:\nAdditional information regarding corrosion control can be found in AC-43-4, Chapter\n6, or AC43.13-1B Chapter 6.\nC.\nAxle bolt hole corrosion.\n(1)\nOperation of an airplane on skis increases the loads on the lower part of the gear spring because\nof the unsymmetrical and twisting loads.\n(a)\nThe increased loads have produced spring fractures that originate from pits in the axle\nattach holes.\n1\nCatastrophic failures have occurred from fatigue cracks as small as 0.003 to 0.010\ninch long that originated at pits.\n(b)\nAlthough operation on skis causes more loads, the criteria applies to all airplanes.\n(2)\nThere is no acceptable damage depth for pits that develop in the axle bolt holes. If pits or\ncorrosion is found it must be removed by reaming, subject to the following limitations:\n(a)\nRemove the minimum material required to clean up the damage.\n(b)\nMake sure the diameter of the axle attachment holes is 0.383 inches maximum for 3/8 inch\nbolts.\n(c)\nMake sure the diameter of the axle attachment holes is 0.321 inches maximum for 5/16\ninch bolts.\n(d)\nIf reaming to the maximum dimension does not remove all signs of corrosion, discard the\nlanding gear spring.\n"

        "answer": "WARNING: Inadequate panel replacement of the engine nacelle may compromise aircraft integrity. Always wear insulated gloves, follow approved methods, and check for discoloration before returning to service.\n\n1.\nGeneral\nA.\nCorrosion is a natural phenomenon which destroys metal by chemical or electrochemical action and\nconverts it to a metallic compound such as an oxide, hydroxide, or sulfate. All metals used in airplane\nconstruction are subject to corrosion. If exposed, attack may take place over an entire metal surface.\nIt may penetrate a surface at random forming deep pits or may follow grain boundaries.

        "question": "What specific challenges or limitations may arise when attempting to visually inspect metal surfaces that are protected by paint or plating for signs of corrosive attack, and how can these challenges be addressed to ensure effective corrosion detection?",
        "answer": "CAUTION: If tool availability is not confirmed, abort the panel replacement and conduct a full inspection of the fuselage skin. Failure to follow this step can result in misalignment.\n\n4.\nCorrosion Detection\nA.\nThe primary means of corrosion detection is visual, but in situations where visual inspection is not\nfeasible, other techniques must be used. The use of liquid dye penetrants, magnetic particle, X-ray,\nand ultrasonic devices can be used, but most of these sophisticated techniques are intended for the\ndetection of physical aws within metal objects rather than the detection of corrosion.\n(1)\nVisual Inspection.\n(a)\nA visual check of the metal surface can reveal the signs of corrosive attack, the most\nobvious of which is a corrosive deposit. Corrosion deposits of aluminum or magnesium\nare generally a white or grayish-white powder, while the color of ferrous compounds varies\nfrom red to dark reddish-brown.\n1\nThe indications of corrosive attack are small localized discoloration of the metal\nsurface. Surfaces protected by paint or plating may only exhibit indications of more\nadvanced corrosive attack by the presence of blisters or bulges in the protective lm.\nBulges in lap joints are indications of corrosive buildup which is well advanced.\n2\nIn may cases, because the inspection area is obscured by structural members,\nequipment installations, or for other reasons, it is awkward to check visually. In such\ncases, mirrors, boroscopes, or like devices must be used to inspect the obscured\nareas. Any means which allows a thorough inspection can be used. Magnifying\nglasses are valuable aids for determining whether or not all corrosion products have\nbeen removed during cleanup operations.\n(2)\nLiquid Dye Penetrant Inspection.\n(a)\nInspection for large stress-corrosion or corrosion fatigue cracks on nonporous or\nnonferrous metals may be accomplished using dye penetrant processes. The dye applied\nto a clean metallic surface will enter small openings or cracks by capillary action. After\nthe dye has an opportunity to be absorbed by any surface discontinuities, the excess dye\nis removed and a developer is applied to the surface. The developer acts like a blotter to\ndraw the dye from cracks or ssures back to the surface, giving visible indication of any\nfault that is present on the surface. The magnitude of the fault is indicated by the quantity\nof dye brought back to the surface by the developer."

        "answer": "NOTE: This procedure applies specifically to aircraft models with engine nacelle configurations post-2015. For older models, refer to AMM revision 22B or later. Always verify tool availability before beginning.\n\n2.\nTypes of Corrosion\nA.\nDirect Surface Attack.\n(1)\nThe most common type of general surface corrosion results from direct reaction of a metal\nsurface with oxygen in the atmosphere. Unless properly protected, steel will rust and aluminum\nand magnesium will form oxides. The attack may be accelerated by salt spray or salt bearing\nair, by industrial gasses, or by engine exhaust gasses.\nB.\nPitting.\n(1)\nWhile pitting can occur in any metal, it is particularly characteristic of passive materials such\nas alloys of aluminum, nickel, and chromium. It is rst noticeable as a white or gray powdery\ndeposit similar to dust, which blotches the surface. When the deposits are cleaned away, tiny\npits can be seen in the surface.\nC.\nDissimilar Metal Corrosion.\n(1)\nWhen two dissimilar metals are in contact and are connected by an electrolyte (continuous liquid\nor gas path), accelerated corrosion of one of the metals occurs. The most easily oxidized surface\nbecomes the anode and corrodes. The less active member of the couple becomes the cathode\nof the galvanic cell. The degree of attack depends on the relative activity of the two surfaces; the\ngreater the difference in activity, the more severe the corrosion. Relative activity in descending\norder is as follows:\n(a)\nMagnesium and its alloys.\n(b)\nAluminum alloys 1100, 3003, 5052, 6061, 220, 355, 356, cadmium, and zinc.\n(c)\nAluminum alloys 2014, 2017, 2024, and 7075.\n(d)\nIron, lead, and their alloys (except stainless steel).\n(e)\nStainless steels, titanium, chromium, nickel, copper, and their alloys.\n(f)\nGraphite (including dry lm lubricants containing graphite).\nD.\nIntergranular Corrosion.\n(1)\nSelective attack along the grain boundaries in metal alloys is referred to as intergranular\ncorrosion. It results from lack of uniformity in the alloy structure. It is particularly characteristic\nof precipitation hardened alloys of aluminum and some stainless steels. Aluminum extrusions\nand forgings in general may contain nonuniform areas, which in turn may result in galvanic\nattack along the grain boundaries. When attack is well advanced, the metal may blister or\ndelaminate which is referred to as exfoliation.\nE.\nStress Corrosion.\n(1)\nThis results from the combined effect of static tensile stresses applied to a surface over\na period of time.\nIn general, cracking susceptibility increases with stress, particularly at\nstresses approaching the yield point, and with increasing temperature, exposure time, and\nconcentration of corrosive ingredients in the surrounding environment. Examples of parts which\nare susceptible to stress corrosion cracking are aluminum alloy bell cranks, landing gear shock\nstruts with pipe thread-type grease ttings, clevis points, and shrink ts.\nF.\nCorrosion Fatigue.\n(1)\nThis is a type of stress corrosion resulting from the cyclic stresses on a metal in corrosive\nsurroundings. Corrosion may start at the bottom of a shallow pit in the stressed area. Once\nattack begins, the continuous exing prevents repair of protective surface coating or oxide lms\nand additional corrosion takes place in the area of stress."

The attack may be accelerated by salt spray or salt bearing\nair, by industrial gasses, or by engine exhaust gasses.\nB.\nPitting.\n(1)\nWhile pitting can occur in any metal, it is particularly characteristic of passive materials such\nas alloys of aluminum, nickel, and chromium. It is rst noticeable as a white or gray powdery\ndeposit similar to dust, which blotches the surface. When the deposits are cleaned away, tiny\npits can be seen in the surface.\nC.\nDissimilar Metal Corrosion.\n(1)\nWhen two dissimilar metals are in contact and are connected by an electrolyte (continuous liquid\nor gas path), accelerated corrosion of one of the metals occurs. The most easily oxidized surface\nbecomes the anode and corrodes. The less active member of the couple becomes the cathode\nof the galvanic cell. The degree of attack depends on the relative activity of the two surfaces; the\ngreater the difference in activity, the more severe the corrosion. Relative activity in descending\norder is as follows:\n(a)\nMagnesium and its alloys.\n(b)\nAluminum alloys 1100, 3003, 5052, 6061, 220, 355, 356, cadmium, and zinc.\n(c)\nAluminum alloys 2014, 2017, 2024, and 7075.\n(d)\nIron, lead, and their alloys (except stainless steel).\n(e)\nStainless steels, titanium, chromium, nickel, copper, and their alloys.\n(f)\nGraphite (including dry lm lubricants containing graphite).\nD.\nIntergranular Corrosion.\n(1)\nSelective attack along the grain boundaries in metal alloys is referred to as intergranular\ncorrosion. It results from lack of uniformity in the alloy structure. It is particularly characteristic\nof precipitation hardened alloys of aluminum and some stainless steels. Aluminum extrusions\nand forgings in general may contain nonuniform areas, which in turn may result in galvanic\nattack along the grain boundaries. When attack is well advanced, the metal may blister or\ndelaminate which is referred to as exfoliation.\nE.\nStress Corrosion.\n(1)\nThis results from the combined effect of static tensile stresses applied to a surface over\na period of time.\nIn general, cracking susceptibility increases with stress, particularly at\nstresses approaching the yield point, and with increasing temperature, exposure time, and\nconcentration of corrosive ingredients in the surrounding environment. Examples of parts which\nare susceptible to stress corrosion cracking are aluminum alloy bell cranks, landing gear shock\nstruts with pipe thread-type grease ttings, clevis points, and shrink ts.\nF.\nCorrosion Fatigue.\n(1)\nThis is a type of stress corrosion resulting from the cyclic stresses on a metal in corrosive\nsurroundings. Corrosion may start at the bottom of a shallow pit in the stressed area. Once\nattack begins, the continuous exing prevents repair of protective surface coating or oxide lms\nand additional corrosion takes place in the area of stress."

        "question": "How does the use of rivets, bolts, or welds as a conductor contribute to the electrochemical corrosion process in airplane construction materials?",
        "answer": "WARNING: Inadequate panel replacement of the engine nacelle may compromise aircraft integrity. Always wear insulated gloves, follow approved methods, and check for discoloration before returning to service.\n\n1.\nGeneral\nA.\nCorrosion is a natural phenomenon which destroys metal by chemical or electrochemical action and\nconverts it to a metallic compound such as an oxide, hydroxide, or sulfate. All metals used in airplane\nconstruction are subject to corrosion. If exposed, attack may take place over an entire metal surface.\nIt may penetrate a surface at random forming deep pits or may follow grain boundaries. Corrosion may\nbe accentuated by stresses from external loads or from lack of homogeneity in the metallic structure\nor from improper heat treatment. It is promoted by contact between dissimilar metals or with materials\nwhich absorb moisture such as wool, rubber, felt, dirt, and so forth.\nNOTE:\nFor additional information on corrosion control for aircraft, refer to the FAA Advisory Circular\nNo. 43-4.\n(1)\nRefer to Figure 1 for a simplied illustration of the conditions which must exist for electrochemical\ncorrosion to occur.\n(a)\nThere must be a metal that corrodes and acts as the anode.\n(b)\nThere must be a less corrodible metal that acts as the cathode\n(c)\nThere must be a continuous liquid path between the two metals which acts as the\nelectrolyte, usually condensation and salt or other contamination.\n(d)\nThere must be a conductor to carry the ow of electrons from the cathode to the anode.\nThis conductor is usually in the form of a metal-to-metal contact (rivets, bolts, welds, etc.)\n(2)\nThe elimination of any one of the four conditions described above will stop the corrosion reaction\nprocess as shown in Figure 1.\n(3)\nOne of the best ways to eliminate one of the four described conditions is to apply an organic lm\n(such as paint, grease, plastic, etc.) to the surface of the metal affected. This will prevent the\nelectrolyte from connecting the cathode to the anode, and since current cannot ow, it prevents\ncorrosive reaction.\n(4)\nAt normal atmospheric temperatures, metals do not corrode appreciably without moisture, but\nthe moisture in the air is usually enough to start corrosive action.\n(5)\nWhen components and systems constructed of many different types of metals must perform\nunder various climatic conditions, corrosion becomes a complex problem. The presence of salts\non metal surfaces (from sea coast operation) greatly increases the electrical conductivity of any\nmoisture present and accelerates corrosion.\n(6)\nOther environmental conditions which contribute to corrosion are:\n(a)\nMoisture collecting on dirt particles.\n(b)\nMoisture collecting in crevices between lap joints, around rivets, bolt, and screws."

If exposed, attack may take place over an entire metal surface.\nIt may penetrate a surface at random forming deep pits or may follow grain boundaries. Corrosion may\nbe accentuated by stresses from external loads or from lack of homogeneity in the metallic structure\nor from improper heat treatment. It is promoted by contact between dissimilar metals or with materials\nwhich absorb moisture such as wool, rubber, felt, dirt, and so forth.\nNOTE:\nFor additional information on corrosion control for aircraft, refer to the FAA Advisory Circular\nNo. 43-4.\n(1)\nRefer to Figure 1 for a simplied illustration of the conditions which must exist for electrochemical\ncorrosion to occur.\n(a)\nThere must be a metal that corrodes and acts as the anode.\n(b)\nThere must be a less corrodible metal that acts as the cathode\n(c)\nThere must be a continuous liquid path between the two metals which acts as the\nelectrolyte, usually condensation and salt or other contamination.\n(d)\nThere must be a conductor to carry the ow of electrons from the cathode to the anode.\nThis conductor is usually in the form of a metal-to-metal contact (rivets, bolts, welds, etc.)\n(2)\nThe elimination of any one of the four conditions described above will stop the corrosion reaction\nprocess as shown in Figure 1.\n(3)\nOne of the best ways to eliminate one of the four described conditions is to apply an organic lm\n(such as paint, grease, plastic, etc.) to the surface of the metal affected.

        "question": "How does the dye penetrant process work to detect stress-corrosion or corrosion fatigue cracks on nonporous or nonferrous metals?",
        "answer": "CAUTION: If tool availability is not confirmed, abort the panel replacement and conduct a full inspection of the fuselage skin. Failure to follow this step can result in misalignment.\n\n4.\nCorrosion Detection\nA.\nThe primary means of corrosion detection is visual, but in situations where visual inspection is not\nfeasible, other techniques must be used. The use of liquid dye penetrants, magnetic particle, X-ray,\nand ultrasonic devices can be used, but most of these sophisticated techniques are intended for the\ndetection of physical aws within metal objects rather than the detection of corrosion.\n(1)\nVisual Inspection.\n(a)\nA visual check of the metal surface can reveal the signs of corrosive attack, the most\nobvious of which is a corrosive deposit. Corrosion deposits of aluminum or magnesium\nare generally a white or grayish-white powder, while the color of ferrous compounds varies\nfrom red to dark reddish-brown.\n1\nThe indications of corrosive attack are small localized discoloration of the metal\nsurface. Surfaces protected by paint or plating may only exhibit indications of more\nadvanced corrosive attack by the presence of blisters or bulges in the protective lm.\nBulges in lap joints are indications of corrosive buildup which is well advanced.\n2\nIn may cases, because the inspection area is obscured by structural members,\nequipment installations, or for other reasons, it is awkward to check visually. In such\ncases, mirrors, boroscopes, or like devices must be used to inspect the obscured\nareas. Any means which allows a thorough inspection can be used. Magnifying\nglasses are valuable aids for determining whether or not all corrosion products have\nbeen removed during cleanup operations.\n(2)\nLiquid Dye Penetrant Inspection.\n(a)\nInspection for large stress-corrosion or corrosion fatigue cracks on nonporous or\nnonferrous metals may be accomplished using dye penetrant processes. The dye applied\nto a clean metallic surface will enter small openings or cracks by capillary action. After\nthe dye has an opportunity to be absorbed by any surface discontinuities, the excess dye\nis removed and a developer is applied to the surface. The developer acts like a blotter to\ndraw the dye from cracks or ssures back to the surface, giving visible indication of any\nfault that is present on the surface. The magnitude of the fault is indicated by the quantity\nof dye brought back to the surface by the developer."

Carefully evacuate personnel, and consult section 05-20-00 of the maintenance manual for proper panel replacement steps.\n\n7.\nControl of Corrosion on Landing Gear Springs\nA.\nGeneral\n(1)\nThe main landing gear springs are made from high strength steel that is shot peened on the\nlower surface to increase the fatigue life of the part.\n(2)\nThe shot peened layer is between 0.010 and 0.020 inch thick.\n(3)\nIf the protective layer of paint is chipped, scratched or worn away the steel may corrode (rust).\n(a)\nIf the corrosion pit depth is greater than the thickness of the shot peen layer, the gear spring\nfatigue life will be greatly reduced.\n(4)\nOperation from unimproved surfaces increases the likelihood of damage.\nB.\nCorrosion removal and repair.\n(1)\nIf damage to the paint nish of the landing gear spring is found, examine the damage area for\nsigns of corrosion (red rust).\nWARNING: High strength steel parts are very susceptible to hydrogen\nembrittlement.\nAcidic solutions, such as rust removers\nand paint strippers have been found to cause hydrogen\nembrittlement.\nHydrogen embrittlement is an undetectable,\ntime delayed process.\nSince the process is time delayed,\nfailure may occur after the part is returned to service.\nThe\nonly reliable way to prevent hydrogen embrittlement is not to\nuse chemical rust removers or paint strippers on landing gear\nsprings.\n(2)\nCarefully remove any rust by light sanding.\n(a)\nThe sanding should blend the damage into the surrounding area in an approximate 20:1\nratio.\nEXAMPLE:\nAn 0.005 inch pit must be blended to a 0.10 inch radius or 0.20 inch\ndiameter.\n(b)\nMake sure the nal sanding marks are along an inboard to outboard direction, or along the\nlong dimension of the spring.\n(3)\nAfter the sanding is complete, measure the depth of the damage removal.\n(a)\nMake sure the depth of the damage is not more than 0.010 to 0.012 inch deep and has not\npenetrated the shot peen layer.\n(4)\nIf the shot peened layer has been penetrated, the gear spring must be removed and sent to an\napproved facility to be re-shotpeened.\n(a)\nThe shotpeen specication is to be Almen intensity of 0.012 to 0.016 using 330 steel shot.\n(5)\nAfter the spring is installed, renish any damaged or removed nish paint.\nNOTE:\nAdditional information regarding corrosion control can be found in AC-43-4, Chapter\n6, or AC43.13-1B Chapter 6.\nC.\nAxle bolt hole corrosion.\n(1)\nOperation of an airplane on skis increases the loads on the lower part of the gear spring because\nof the unsymmetrical and twisting loads.\n(a)\nThe increased loads have produced spring fractures that originate from pits in the axle\nattach holes.\n1\nCatastrophic failures have occurred from fatigue cracks as small as 0.003 to 0.010\ninch long that originated at pits.\n(b)\nAlthough operation on skis causes more loads, the criteria applies to all airplanes.\n(2)\nThere is no acceptable damage depth for pits that develop in the axle bolt holes. If pits or\ncorrosion is found it must be removed by reaming, subject to the following limitations:\n(a)\nRemove the minimum material required to clean up the damage.\n(b)\nMake sure the diameter of the axle attachment holes is 0.383 inches maximum for 3/8 inch\nbolts.\n(c)\nMake sure the diameter of the axle attachment holes is 0.321 inches maximum for 5/16\ninch bolts.\n(d)\nIf reaming to the maximum dimension does not remove all signs of corrosion, discard the\nlanding gear spring.\n"

        "question": "What happens to the corrosion reaction process when any one of the four conditions necessary for electrochemical corrosion to occur is eliminated in airplane construction materials?",
        "answer": "WARNING: Inadequate panel replacement of the engine nacelle may compromise aircraft integrity. Always wear insulated gloves, follow approved methods, and check for discoloration before returning to service.\n\n1.\nGeneral\nA.\nCorrosion is a natural phenomenon which destroys metal by chemical or electrochemical action and\nconverts it to a metallic compound such as an oxide, hydroxide, or sulfate. All metals used in airplane\nconstruction are subject to corrosion. If exposed, attack may take place over an entire metal surface.\nIt may penetrate a surface at random forming deep pits or may follow grain boundaries. Corrosion may\nbe accentuated by stresses from external loads or from lack of homogeneity in the metallic structure\nor from improper heat treatment. It is promoted by contact between dissimilar metals or with materials\nwhich absorb moisture such as wool, rubber, felt, dirt, and so forth.\nNOTE:\nFor additional information on corrosion control for aircraft, refer to the FAA Advisory Circular\nNo. 43-4.\n(1)\nRefer to Figure 1 for a simplied illustration of the conditions which must exist for electrochemical\ncorrosion to occur.\n(a)\nThere must be a metal that corrodes and acts as the anode.\n(b)\nThere must be a less corrodible metal that acts as the cathode\n(c)\nThere must be a continuous liquid path between the two metals which acts as the\nelectrolyte, usually condensation and salt or other contamination.\n(d)\nThere must be a conductor to carry the ow of electrons from the cathode to the anode.\nThis conductor is usually in the form of a metal-to-metal contact (rivets, bolts, welds, etc.)\n(2)\nThe elimination of any one of the four conditions described above will stop the corrosion reaction\nprocess as shown in Figure 1.\n(3)\nOne of the best ways to eliminate one of the four described conditions is to apply an organic lm\n(such as paint, grease, plastic, etc.) to the surface of the metal affected. This will prevent the\nelectrolyte from connecting the cathode to the anode, and since current cannot ow, it prevents\ncorrosive reaction.\n(4)\nAt normal atmospheric temperatures, metals do not corrode appreciably without moisture, but\nthe moisture in the air is usually enough to start corrosive action.\n(5)\nWhen components and systems constructed of many different types of metals must perform\nunder various climatic conditions, corrosion becomes a complex problem. The presence of salts\non metal surfaces (from sea coast operation) greatly increases the electrical conductivity of any\nmoisture present and accelerates corrosion.\n(6)\nOther environmental conditions which contribute to corrosion are:\n(a)\nMoisture collecting on dirt particles.\n(b)\nMoisture collecting in crevices between lap joints, around rivets, bolt, and screws."

The attack may be accelerated by salt spray or salt bearing\nair, by industrial gasses, or by engine exhaust gasses.\nB.\nPitting.\n(1)\nWhile pitting can occur in any metal, it is particularly characteristic of passive materials such\nas alloys of aluminum, nickel, and chromium. It is rst noticeable as a white or gray powdery\ndeposit similar to dust, which blotches the surface. When the deposits are cleaned away, tiny\npits can be seen in the surface.\nC.\nDissimilar Metal Corrosion.\n(1)\nWhen two dissimilar metals are in contact and are connected by an electrolyte (continuous liquid\nor gas path), accelerated corrosion of one of the metals occurs. The most easily oxidized surface\nbecomes the anode and corrodes. The less active member of the couple becomes the cathode\nof the galvanic cell. The degree of attack depends on the relative activity of the two surfaces; the\ngreater the difference in activity, the more severe the corrosion. Relative activity in descending\norder is as follows:\n(a)\nMagnesium and its alloys.\n(b)\nAluminum alloys 1100, 3003, 5052, 6061, 220, 355, 356, cadmium, and zinc.\n(c)\nAluminum alloys 2014, 2017, 2024, and 7075.\n(d)\nIron, lead, and their alloys (except stainless steel).\n(e)\nStainless steels, titanium, chromium, nickel, copper, and their alloys.\n(f)\nGraphite (including dry lm lubricants containing graphite).\nD.\nIntergranular Corrosion.\n(1)\nSelective attack along the grain boundaries in metal alloys is referred to as intergranular\ncorrosion. It results from lack of uniformity in the alloy structure. It is particularly characteristic\nof precipitation hardened alloys of aluminum and some stainless steels. Aluminum extrusions\nand forgings in general may contain nonuniform areas, which in turn may result in galvanic\nattack along the grain boundaries. When attack is well advanced, the metal may blister or\ndelaminate which is referred to as exfoliation.\nE.\nStress Corrosion.\n(1)\nThis results from the combined effect of static tensile stresses applied to a surface over\na period of time.\nIn general, cracking susceptibility increases with stress, particularly at\nstresses approaching the yield point, and with increasing temperature, exposure time, and\nconcentration of corrosive ingredients in the surrounding environment. Examples of parts which\nare susceptible to stress corrosion cracking are aluminum alloy bell cranks, landing gear shock\nstruts with pipe thread-type grease ttings, clevis points, and shrink ts.\nF.\nCorrosion Fatigue.\n(1)\nThis is a type of stress corrosion resulting from the cyclic stresses on a metal in corrosive\nsurroundings. Corrosion may start at the bottom of a shallow pit in the stressed area. Once\nattack begins, the continuous exing prevents repair of protective surface coating or oxide lms\nand additional corrosion takes place in the area of stress."

Select appropriate materials from the abrasives chart as illustrated\nin Figure 2.\n(2)\nAluminum and Aluminum Alloys.\n(a)\nMost formed aluminum parts and skins of this airplane consist of various gauges of sheet\n2024-T3 and 2024-T42 Alclad. Alclad is formed by laminating a thin layer of relatively\npure aluminum, one to ve mils thick, over the higher strength base alloy surface. Since\npure aluminum has relatively greater corrosion resistance than the stronger alloy, it is\nimperative the clad surface be maintained intact to the maximum extent possible and to\navoid unnecessary mechanical removal of the protective coating. In addition, aluminum\nparts receive a chemical conversion coating and are then epoxy-primed.\n1\nClean area to be reworked.

        "answer": "WARNING: solvent cleaners must never be used near fuselage skin due to risk of toxic exposure. Before beginning the sealant application, ensure that the area is free of coolant vapor and personnel are wearing inspection mirror.\n\n3.\nTypical Corrosion Areas\nA.\nThis section lists typical areas of the airplane which are susceptible to corrosion. These areas should\nbe carefully inspected at periodic intervals to detect corrosion as early as possible.\n(1)\nEngine Exhaust Trail Areas.\n(a)\nGaps, seams, and fairings on the lower fuselage, aft of the engine exhaust pipe(s) are\ntypical areas where deposits may be trapped and not reached by normal cleaning methods.\n(b)\nAround rivet heads, skin laps and inspection covers on the airplane lower fuselage aft of\nthe engine exhaust pipe(s) should be carefully cleaned and inspected.\n(2)\nBattery Box and Battery Vent Opening.\n(a)\nThe battery, battery cover, battery box, and adjacent areas, especially areas below the\nbattery box where battery electrolyte may have seeped, are particularly subject to corrosive\naction. If spilled battery electrolyte is neutralized and cleaned up at the same time of\nspillage, corrosion can be held to a minimum by using a baking soda solution to neutralize\nthe lead acid-type battery electrolyte. If baking soda is not available, ood the area with\nwater.\n(3)\nStainless Steel control cables.\n(a)\nChecking for corrosion on control cables is normally accomplished during the preventative\nmaintenance check. During preventative maintenance, broken wire and wear of the control\ncable is also checked.\n(b)\nIf the surface of the cable is corroded, carefully force the cable open by reverse twisting\nand visually inspect the interior. Corrosion on the interior strands of the cable constitutes\nfailure and the cable must be replaced. If no internal corrosion is detected, remove loose\nexternal rust and corrosion with a clean, dry, coarse-weave rag or ber brush.\nNOTE:\nDo not use metallic wools or solvents to clean installed cables. Use of metallic\nwool will embed dissimilar metal particles in the cables and create further\ncorrosion. Solvents will remove internal cable lubricant, allowing cable strands\nto abrade and further corrode.\n(c)\nAfter thorough cleaning of the exterior cable surface, apply a light coat of lubricant (VV-L-\n800) to the external cable surface."

        "question": "How do the colors of corrosion deposits vary for ferrous compounds compared to aluminum or magnesium during a visual inspection for corrosion detection?",
        "answer": "CAUTION: If tool availability is not confirmed, abort the panel replacement and conduct a full inspection of the fuselage skin. Failure to follow this step can result in misalignment.\n\n4.\nCorrosion Detection\nA.\nThe primary means of corrosion detection is visual, but in situations where visual inspection is not\nfeasible, other techniques must be used. The use of liquid dye penetrants, magnetic particle, X-ray,\nand ultrasonic devices can be used, but most of these sophisticated techniques are intended for the\ndetection of physical aws within metal objects rather than the detection of corrosion.\n(1)\nVisual Inspection.\n(a)\nA visual check of the metal surface can reveal the signs of corrosive attack, the most\nobvious of which is a corrosive deposit. Corrosion deposits of aluminum or magnesium\nare generally a white or grayish-white powder, while the color of ferrous compounds varies\nfrom red to dark reddish-brown.\n1\nThe indications of corrosive attack are small localized discoloration of the metal\nsurface. Surfaces protected by paint or plating may only exhibit indications of more\nadvanced corrosive attack by the presence of blisters or bulges in the protective lm.\nBulges in lap joints are indications of corrosive buildup which is well advanced.\n2\nIn may cases, because the inspection area is obscured by structural members,\nequipment installations, or for other reasons, it is awkward to check visually. In such\ncases, mirrors, boroscopes, or like devices must be used to inspect the obscured\nareas. Any means which allows a thorough inspection can be used. Magnifying\nglasses are valuable aids for determining whether or not all corrosion products have\nbeen removed during cleanup operations.\n(2)\nLiquid Dye Penetrant Inspection.\n(a)\nInspection for large stress-corrosion or corrosion fatigue cracks on nonporous or\nnonferrous metals may be accomplished using dye penetrant processes. The dye applied\nto a clean metallic surface will enter small openings or cracks by capillary action. After\nthe dye has an opportunity to be absorbed by any surface discontinuities, the excess dye\nis removed and a developer is applied to the surface. The developer acts like a blotter to\ndraw the dye from cracks or ssures back to the surface, giving visible indication of any\nfault that is present on the surface. The magnitude of the fault is indicated by the quantity\nof dye brought back to the surface by the developer."

        "answer": "NOTE: This procedure applies specifically to aircraft models with engine nacelle configurations post-2015. For older models, refer to AMM revision 22B or later. Always verify tool availability before beginning.\n\n2.\nTypes of Corrosion\nA.\nDirect Surface Attack.\n(1)\nThe most common type of general surface corrosion results from direct reaction of a metal\nsurface with oxygen in the atmosphere. Unless properly protected, steel will rust and aluminum\nand magnesium will form oxides. The attack may be accelerated by salt spray or salt bearing\nair, by industrial gasses, or by engine exhaust gasses.\nB.\nPitting.\n(1)\nWhile pitting can occur in any metal, it is particularly characteristic of passive materials such\nas alloys of aluminum, nickel, and chromium. It is rst noticeable as a white or gray powdery\ndeposit similar to dust, which blotches the surface. When the deposits are cleaned away, tiny\npits can be seen in the surface.\nC.\nDissimilar Metal Corrosion.\n(1)\nWhen two dissimilar metals are in contact and are connected by an electrolyte (continuous liquid\nor gas path), accelerated corrosion of one of the metals occurs. The most easily oxidized surface\nbecomes the anode and corrodes. The less active member of the couple becomes the cathode\nof the galvanic cell. The degree of attack depends on the relative activity of the two surfaces; the\ngreater the difference in activity, the more severe the corrosion. Relative activity in descending\norder is as follows:\n(a)\nMagnesium and its alloys.\n(b)\nAluminum alloys 1100, 3003, 5052, 6061, 220, 355, 356, cadmium, and zinc.\n(c)\nAluminum alloys 2014, 2017, 2024, and 7075.\n(d)\nIron, lead, and their alloys (except stainless steel).\n(e)\nStainless steels, titanium, chromium, nickel, copper, and their alloys.\n(f)\nGraphite (including dry lm lubricants containing graphite).\nD.\nIntergranular Corrosion.\n(1)\nSelective attack along the grain boundaries in metal alloys is referred to as intergranular\ncorrosion. It results from lack of uniformity in the alloy structure. It is particularly characteristic\nof precipitation hardened alloys of aluminum and some stainless steels. Aluminum extrusions\nand forgings in general may contain nonuniform areas, which in turn may result in galvanic\nattack along the grain boundaries. When attack is well advanced, the metal may blister or\ndelaminate which is referred to as exfoliation.\nE.\nStress Corrosion.\n(1)\nThis results from the combined effect of static tensile stresses applied to a surface over\na period of time.\nIn general, cracking susceptibility increases with stress, particularly at\nstresses approaching the yield point, and with increasing temperature, exposure time, and\nconcentration of corrosive ingredients in the surrounding environment. Examples of parts which\nare susceptible to stress corrosion cracking are aluminum alloy bell cranks, landing gear shock\nstruts with pipe thread-type grease ttings, clevis points, and shrink ts.\nF.\nCorrosion Fatigue.\n(1)\nThis is a type of stress corrosion resulting from the cyclic stresses on a metal in corrosive\nsurroundings. Corrosion may start at the bottom of a shallow pit in the stressed area. Once\nattack begins, the continuous exing prevents repair of protective surface coating or oxide lms\nand additional corrosion takes place in the area of stress."

        "question": "In what situations are techniques such as liquid dye penetrants, magnetic particle, X-ray, and ultrasonic devices typically used for corrosion detection, and what are their primary applications?",
        "answer": "CAUTION: If tool availability is not confirmed, abort the panel replacement and conduct a full inspection of the fuselage skin. Failure to follow this step can result in misalignment.\n\n4.\nCorrosion Detection\nA.\nThe primary means of corrosion detection is visual, but in situations where visual inspection is not\nfeasible, other techniques must be used. The use of liquid dye penetrants, magnetic particle, X-ray,\nand ultrasonic devices can be used, but most of these sophisticated techniques are intended for the\ndetection of physical aws within metal objects rather than the detection of corrosion.\n(1)\nVisual Inspection.\n(a)\nA visual check of the metal surface can reveal the signs of corrosive attack, the most\nobvious of which is a corrosive deposit. Corrosion deposits of aluminum or magnesium\nare generally a white or grayish-white powder, while the color of ferrous compounds varies\nfrom red to dark reddish-brown.\n1\nThe indications of corrosive attack are small localized discoloration of the metal\nsurface. Surfaces protected by paint or plating may only exhibit indications of more\nadvanced corrosive attack by the presence of blisters or bulges in the protective lm.\nBulges in lap joints are indications of corrosive buildup which is well advanced.\n2\nIn may cases, because the inspection area is obscured by structural members,\nequipment installations, or for other reasons, it is awkward to check visually. In such\ncases, mirrors, boroscopes, or like devices must be used to inspect the obscured\nareas. Any means which allows a thorough inspection can be used. Magnifying\nglasses are valuable aids for determining whether or not all corrosion products have\nbeen removed during cleanup operations.\n(2)\nLiquid Dye Penetrant Inspection.\n(a)\nInspection for large stress-corrosion or corrosion fatigue cracks on nonporous or\nnonferrous metals may be accomplished using dye penetrant processes. The dye applied\nto a clean metallic surface will enter small openings or cracks by capillary action. After\nthe dye has an opportunity to be absorbed by any surface discontinuities, the excess dye\nis removed and a developer is applied to the surface. The developer acts like a blotter to\ndraw the dye from cracks or ssures back to the surface, giving visible indication of any\nfault that is present on the surface. The magnitude of the fault is indicated by the quantity\nof dye brought back to the surface by the developer."

        "question": "What should be done to inspect the interior of a corroded stainless steel control cable?",
        "answer": "WARNING: solvent cleaners must never be used near fuselage skin due to risk of toxic exposure. Before beginning the sealant application, ensure that the area is free of coolant vapor and personnel are wearing inspection mirror.\n\n3.\nTypical Corrosion Areas\nA.\nThis section lists typical areas of the airplane which are susceptible to corrosion. These areas should\nbe carefully inspected at periodic intervals to detect corrosion as early as possible.\n(1)\nEngine Exhaust Trail Areas.\n(a)\nGaps, seams, and fairings on the lower fuselage, aft of the engine exhaust pipe(s) are\ntypical areas where deposits may be trapped and not reached by normal cleaning methods.\n(b)\nAround rivet heads, skin laps and inspection covers on the airplane lower fuselage aft of\nthe engine exhaust pipe(s) should be carefully cleaned and inspected.\n(2)\nBattery Box and Battery Vent Opening.\n(a)\nThe battery, battery cover, battery box, and adjacent areas, especially areas below the\nbattery box where battery electrolyte may have seeped, are particularly subject to corrosive\naction. If spilled battery electrolyte is neutralized and cleaned up at the same time of\nspillage, corrosion can be held to a minimum by using a baking soda solution to neutralize\nthe lead acid-type battery electrolyte. If baking soda is not available, ood the area with\nwater.\n(3)\nStainless Steel control cables.\n(a)\nChecking for corrosion on control cables is normally accomplished during the preventative\nmaintenance check. During preventative maintenance, broken wire and wear of the control\ncable is also checked.\n(b)\nIf the surface of the cable is corroded, carefully force the cable open by reverse twisting\nand visually inspect the interior. Corrosion on the interior strands of the cable constitutes\nfailure and the cable must be replaced. If no internal corrosion is detected, remove loose\nexternal rust and corrosion with a clean, dry, coarse-weave rag or ber brush.\nNOTE:\nDo not use metallic wools or solvents to clean installed cables. Use of metallic\nwool will embed dissimilar metal particles in the cables and create further\ncorrosion. Solvents will remove internal cable lubricant, allowing cable strands\nto abrade and further corrode.\n(c)\nAfter thorough cleaning of the exterior cable surface, apply a light coat of lubricant (VV-L-\n800) to the external cable surface."

        "question": "What is the primary mechanism by which corrosion fatigue occurs, and how does the continuous flexing of a metal in a corrosive environment contribute to the progression of corrosion?",
        "answer": "NOTE: This procedure applies specifically to aircraft models with engine nacelle configurations post-2015. For older models, refer to AMM revision 22B or later. Always verify tool availability before beginning.\n\n2.\nTypes of Corrosion\nA.\nDirect Surface Attack.\n(1)\nThe most common type of general surface corrosion results from direct reaction of a metal\nsurface with oxygen in the atmosphere. Unless properly protected, steel will rust and aluminum\nand magnesium will form oxides. The attack may be accelerated by salt spray or salt bearing\nair, by industrial gasses, or by engine exhaust gasses.\nB.\nPitting.\n(1)\nWhile pitting can occur in any metal, it is particularly characteristic of passive materials such\nas alloys of aluminum, nickel, and chromium. It is rst noticeable as a white or gray powdery\ndeposit similar to dust, which blotches the surface. When the deposits are cleaned away, tiny\npits can be seen in the surface.\nC.\nDissimilar Metal Corrosion.\n(1)\nWhen two dissimilar metals are in contact and are connected by an electrolyte (continuous liquid\nor gas path), accelerated corrosion of one of the metals occurs. The most easily oxidized surface\nbecomes the anode and corrodes. The less active member of the couple becomes the cathode\nof the galvanic cell. The degree of attack depends on the relative activity of the two surfaces; the\ngreater the difference in activity, the more severe the corrosion. Relative activity in descending\norder is as follows:\n(a)\nMagnesium and its alloys.\n(b)\nAluminum alloys 1100, 3003, 5052, 6061, 220, 355, 356, cadmium, and zinc.\n(c)\nAluminum alloys 2014, 2017, 2024, and 7075.\n(d)\nIron, lead, and their alloys (except stainless steel).\n(e)\nStainless steels, titanium, chromium, nickel, copper, and their alloys.\n(f)\nGraphite (including dry lm lubricants containing graphite).\nD.\nIntergranular Corrosion.\n(1)\nSelective attack along the grain boundaries in metal alloys is referred to as intergranular\ncorrosion. It results from lack of uniformity in the alloy structure. It is particularly characteristic\nof precipitation hardened alloys of aluminum and some stainless steels. Aluminum extrusions\nand forgings in general may contain nonuniform areas, which in turn may result in galvanic\nattack along the grain boundaries. When attack is well advanced, the metal may blister or\ndelaminate which is referred to as exfoliation.\nE.\nStress Corrosion.\n(1)\nThis results from the combined effect of static tensile stresses applied to a surface over\na period of time.\nIn general, cracking susceptibility increases with stress, particularly at\nstresses approaching the yield point, and with increasing temperature, exposure time, and\nconcentration of corrosive ingredients in the surrounding environment. Examples of parts which\nare susceptible to stress corrosion cracking are aluminum alloy bell cranks, landing gear shock\nstruts with pipe thread-type grease ttings, clevis points, and shrink ts.\nF.\nCorrosion Fatigue.\n(1)\nThis is a type of stress corrosion resulting from the cyclic stresses on a metal in corrosive\nsurroundings. Corrosion may start at the bottom of a shallow pit in the stressed area. Once\nattack begins, the continuous exing prevents repair of protective surface coating or oxide lms\nand additional corrosion takes place in the area of stress."
