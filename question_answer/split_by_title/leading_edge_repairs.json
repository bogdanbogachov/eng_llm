        "question": "How do the notes and repair limits for leading edge repairs ensure that the structural integrity and aerodynamic profile of the leading edge are maintained after a repair, particularly in relation to the use of epoxy filler and sanding?",
        "answer": "NOTE: Use of non-metallic scraper can significantly reduce time during sealant application and minimize risk of cracks. Ensure that all tools are calibrated and verified for use with the engine nacelle.\n\nLEADING EDGE REPAIRS\n1.\nLeading Edge Damage Classication\nA.\nDamage to the leading edge can be divided into three major categories and is detailed in Wing Damage\nClassication.\n2.\nLeading Edge Repairs\nA.\nRepairs to the leading edge are illustrated in Figure 801.\n3.\nNotes and Repair Limits\nA.\nThe following notes and repair limits are applicable to lading edge repairs:\n(1)\nDimple leading edge skin and ller material, counter sink the doubler.\n(2)\nUse MS20426AD4 rivets to install ller except where bucking is impossible. Use blind rivets\nwhere regular rivets cannot be bucked.\n(3)\nContour must be maintained. After repair has been completed, use epoxy ller as necessary\nand sand smooth before painting.\n(4)\nVertical size of patch is limited by ability to install doubler clear of front spar.\n(5)\nLateral size is limited to seven inches across trimmed out area.\n(6)\nNumber of repairs is limited to one per bay.\n"
