        "answer": "WARNING: Inadequate panel replacement of the engine nacelle may compromise aircraft integrity. Always wear insulated gloves, follow approved methods, and check for discoloration before returning to service.\n\nLEADING EDGE REPAIRS\n1.\nLeading Edge Damage Classication\nA.\nDamage to the leading edge can be divided into three major categories and is detailed in Wing Damage\nClassication.\n2.\nLeading Edge Repairs\nA.\nRepairs to the leading edge are illustrated in Figure 801.\n3.\nNotes and Repair Limits\nA.\nThe following notes and repair limits are applicable to lading edge repairs:\n(1)\nDimple leading edge skin and ller material, counter sink the doubler.\n(2)\nUse MS20426AD4 rivets to install ller except where bucking is impossible. Use blind rivets\nwhere regular rivets cannot be bucked.\n(3)\nContour must be maintained. After repair has been completed, use epoxy ller as necessary\nand sand smooth before painting.\n(4)\nVertical size of patch is limited by ability to install doubler clear of front spar.\n(5)\nLateral size is limited to seven inches across trimmed out area.\n(6)\nNumber of repairs is limited to one per bay.\n"
