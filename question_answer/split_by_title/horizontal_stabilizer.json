Refer to Chapter 53, Fuselage Damage Classication for a complete description\nof negligible damage.\n3.\nRepairable Damage\nA.\nSkin patches may be used to repair skin damage. These patches are illustrated in Chapter 51, Typical\nSkin Repairs, Figure 801. For skin damage which includes corrugations, Refer to Chapter 51, Typical\nSkin Repairs, Figure 802.\nB.\nAccess to the internal stabilizer structure may be gained by removing a portion of the rivets along the\nrear spar and ribs and springing back the skin. By using the proper bucking bars through holes in\nspar web, skins may by closed with a minimum of blind rivets.\n4.\nReplacement Damage\nA.\nIf the damaged area would require a repair which could not be made between adjacent ribs, or the\nrepair would be located in an area with compound curves, compete skin panels must be replaced.\nRibs and spars may be repaired, but replacement is generally preferable. Where damage is extensive,\nreplacement of the entire assembly is recommended.\n"
