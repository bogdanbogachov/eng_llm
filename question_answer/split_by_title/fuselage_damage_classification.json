        "question": "What factors determine whether a wrinkle in the skin of a metal airplane, which is removable by hand, can be effectively repaired using a 1/2 inch x 1/2 inch x 0.050 inch 2024-T42 extruded angle or a heavy “J” section, and what are the key considerations for the placement and riveting of such a repair?",
        "answer": "2.\nNegligible Damage\nA.\nAny smooth dents in the fuselage skin that are free from cracks, abrasions, and sharp corners, and\nwhich are not stress wrinkles and do not interfere with any internal structure or mechanism, may\nbe considered as negligible damage. In areas of low stress intensity, cracks, deep scratches, or\ndeep, sharp dents - which after trimming or stop-drilling can be enclosed by a two-inch circle - can\nbe considered negligible if the damaged area is at least one diameter of the enclosing circle away\nfrom all existing rivet lines and material edges. Stop drilling is considered a temporary repair and a\npermanent repair must be made as soon as practical.\nB.\nMild corrosion appearing upon clad aluminum surfaces does not necessarily indicate incipient failure of\nthe base metal. However, corrosion of all types must be carefully considered, and approved remedial\naction taken.\nC.\nSmall cans appear in the skin structure of all metal airplanes and should not necessarily be a cause\nfor concern. However. It is strongly recommended that wrinkles which appear to have originated from\nother sources, or which do not follow the general appearance of the remainder of the skin panels, be\nthoroughly investigated. Except in the landing gear bulkhead areas, wrinkles occurring over stringers\nwhich disappear when the rivet pattern is removed, may be considered negligible. However, the\nstringer rivet holes may not align perfectly with skin holes because of a permanent \"set\" in the stringer.\nIf this is apparent, replacement of the stringer will usually restore the original strength characteristics\nof the area.\nNOTE:\nWrinkles occurring in the skin of the main landing gear bulkhead areas must not be\nconsidered negligible. The skin panel must be opened sufciently to permit a thorough\nexamination of the lower portion of the landing gear bulkhead and its tie-in structure.\nD.\nWrinkles occurring in open areas which disappear when the rivets at the edge of the sheet are\nremoved, or a wrinkle which is hand removable, may often be repaired by a 1/2 inch x 1/2 inch x\n0.050 inch 2024-T42 extruded angle or a heavy “J” section. The angle should be inserted fore and\naft across the center of the wrinkle and should extend to within 1/16 inch to 1/8 inch of the fuselage\nbulkheads comprising the end of the bay.

        "answer": "2.\nNegligible Damage\nA.\nAny smooth dents in the fuselage skin that are free from cracks, abrasions, and sharp corners, and\nwhich are not stress wrinkles and do not interfere with any internal structure or mechanism, may\nbe considered as negligible damage. In areas of low stress intensity, cracks, deep scratches, or\ndeep, sharp dents - which after trimming or stop-drilling can be enclosed by a two-inch circle - can\nbe considered negligible if the damaged area is at least one diameter of the enclosing circle away\nfrom all existing rivet lines and material edges. Stop drilling is considered a temporary repair and a\npermanent repair must be made as soon as practical.\nB.\nMild corrosion appearing upon clad aluminum surfaces does not necessarily indicate incipient failure of\nthe base metal. However, corrosion of all types must be carefully considered, and approved remedial\naction taken.\nC.\nSmall cans appear in the skin structure of all metal airplanes and should not necessarily be a cause\nfor concern. However. It is strongly recommended that wrinkles which appear to have originated from\nother sources, or which do not follow the general appearance of the remainder of the skin panels, be\nthoroughly investigated. Except in the landing gear bulkhead areas, wrinkles occurring over stringers\nwhich disappear when the rivet pattern is removed, may be considered negligible.

However, corrosion of all types must be carefully considered, and approved remedial\naction taken.\nC.\nSmall cans appear in the skin structure of all metal airplanes and should not necessarily be a cause\nfor concern. However. It is strongly recommended that wrinkles which appear to have originated from\nother sources, or which do not follow the general appearance of the remainder of the skin panels, be\nthoroughly investigated. Except in the landing gear bulkhead areas, wrinkles occurring over stringers\nwhich disappear when the rivet pattern is removed, may be considered negligible. However, the\nstringer rivet holes may not align perfectly with skin holes because of a permanent \"set\" in the stringer.\nIf this is apparent, replacement of the stringer will usually restore the original strength characteristics\nof the area.\nNOTE:\nWrinkles occurring in the skin of the main landing gear bulkhead areas must not be\nconsidered negligible. The skin panel must be opened sufciently to permit a thorough\nexamination of the lower portion of the landing gear bulkhead and its tie-in structure.\nD.\nWrinkles occurring in open areas which disappear when the rivets at the edge of the sheet are\nremoved, or a wrinkle which is hand removable, may often be repaired by a 1/2 inch x 1/2 inch x\n0.050 inch 2024-T42 extruded angle or a heavy “J” section. The angle should be inserted fore and\naft across the center of the wrinkle and should extend to within 1/16 inch to 1/8 inch of the fuselage\nbulkheads comprising the end of the bay. Rivet pattern should be similar to existing manufactured\nseam at edge of sheet.\nE.\nNegligible damage to stringers, formed skin anges, bulkhead channel and like parts is similar to\nthat for the wing skin. Refer to Chapter 57, Wing Damage Classication for a denition of negligible\ndamage to these components."
