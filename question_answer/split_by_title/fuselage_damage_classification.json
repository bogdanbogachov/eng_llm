        "question": "What are the specific conditions under which small dents in the fuselage skin can be considered negligible damage, particularly in terms of their shape, location, and potential interference with internal structures or mechanisms?",

If parts are designed, manufactured, remanufactured, overhauled, purchased, and/or approved by third-party suppliers, then the data in Cessna’s maintenance/service manuals and parts catalogs do not apply and the purchaser is warned not to rely on such data for non-Cessna parts. All maintenance intervals, changeover timelines, major service intervals, the assessment technique, lifespan thresholds, cycle thresholds, etc., for such non-Cessna parts must be obtained from the producer or distributor of such non-Cessna parts.\n\n2.\nNegligible Damage\nA.\nAny smooth dents in the fuselage skin that are free from cracks, abrasions, and sharp corners, and\nwhich are not stress wrinkles and do not interfere with any internal structure or mechanism, may\nbe considered as negligible damage. In areas of low stress intensity, cracks, deep scratches, or\ndeep, sharp dents - which after trimming or stop-drilling can be enclosed by a two-inch circle - can\nbe considered negligible if the damaged area is at least one diameter of the enclosing circle away\nfrom all existing rivet lines and material edges. Stop drilling is considered a temporary repair and a\npermanent repair must be made as soon as practical.\nB.\nMild corrosion appearing upon clad aluminum surfaces does not necessarily indicate incipient failure of\nthe base metal. However, corrosion of all types must be carefully considered, and approved remedial\naction taken.\nC.\nSmall cans appear in the skin structure of all metal airplanes and should not necessarily be a cause\nfor concern. However. It is strongly recommended that wrinkles which appear to have originated from\nother sources, or which do not follow the general appearance of the remainder of the skin panels, be\nthoroughly investigated. Except in the landing gear bulkhead areas, wrinkles occurring over stringers\nwhich disappear when the rivet pattern is removed, may be considered negligible. However, the\nstringer rivet holes may not align perfectly with skin holes because of a permanent \"set\" in the stringer.\nIf this is apparent, replacement of the stringer will usually restore the original strength characteristics\nof the area.\nNOTE:\nWrinkles occurring in the skin of the main landing gear bulkhead areas must not be\nconsidered negligible. The skin panel must be opened sufciently to permit a thorough\nexamination of the lower portion of the landing gear bulkhead and its tie-in structure.\nD.\nWrinkles occurring in open areas which disappear when the rivets at the edge of the sheet are\nremoved, or a wrinkle which is hand removable, may often be repaired by a 1/2 inch x 1/2 inch x\n0.050 inch 2024-T42 extruded angle or a heavy “J” section. The angle should be inserted fore and\naft across the center of the wrinkle and should extend to within 1/16 inch to 1/8 inch of the fuselage\nbulkheads comprising the end of the bay.

In areas of low stress intensity, cracks, deep scratches, or\ndeep, sharp dents - which after trimming or stop-drilling can be enclosed by a two-inch circle - can\nbe considered negligible if the damaged area is at least one diameter of the enclosing circle away\nfrom all existing rivet lines and material edges. Stop drilling is considered a temporary repair and a\npermanent repair must be made as soon as practical.\nB.\nMild corrosion appearing upon clad aluminum surfaces does not necessarily indicate incipient failure of\nthe base metal. However, corrosion of all types must be carefully considered, and approved remedial\naction taken.\nC.\nSmall cans appear in the skin structure of all metal airplanes and should not necessarily be a cause\nfor concern.
