        "question": "In aircraft structures where rivets are used, how does the stress on the sheet influence the decision on whether to space rivets closer together or farther apart, and what are the implications for the structural integrity of the riveted joint?",
        "answer": "NOTE: If the engine nacelle shows any signs of cracks, do not proceed with the panel replacement until proper inspection and corrective action have been taken.\n\n9.\nSpacing Of Rivets\nA.\nThere are no specic rules which are applicable to every case or type of riveting. There are, however,\ncertain general rules which should be understood and followed. Edge distance of rivets should not\nbe less than two diameters of the rivet, measured from the edge of the sheet or plate to the center of\nthe rivet hole. Spacing between rivets, when in rows, depends upon several factors, principally the\nthickness of the sheet, the diameter of the rivets, and the manner in which the sheet will be stressed.\nThis spacing is seldom less than four diameters of the rivet, measured between the centers of the rivet\nholes. Rivets, spaced four diameters apart, are found in certain seams of semimonocoque fuselages,\nwebs or built up spars, and various plates or ttings. Where there are two rows of rivets, they are\nusually staggered. The transverse pitch or distance between rows should be slightly less than the\npitch of the rivets, with 75 percent of the rivet pitch being the usual practice. An average spacing or\npitch of rivets in the cover or skin of most structures, except at highly stressed points, will be from 6\nto 12 diameters of the rivet. The best practice in repair is to make pitch of rivets equal to those in the\noriginal structure."

Helical coil inserts are available in both National Course and\nNational Fine series in lengths equal to 1, 1 -1 /2 and 2 times nominal diameter and in pipe\nthread sizes. They are made of either carbon steel, phosphor bronze or stainless steel, as\nspecified by part number. They are supplied with or without a notch above the driving tang.\nThe notch is provided to facilitate breaking off the tang in open holes.\nHelical coil inserts are helical coils of wire with a diamond-shaped cross section forming both\na male and female thread. When compressed into a special tapped hole at the widest part of\nthe wire, between male and female threads, the diameter of the insert is equal to the nominal\nscrew size. The special finishing taps size the casting hole so the pitch diameter of the\nfemale thread of the installed insert conforms to Class 3 fit with standard bolt threads or class\n4 (tight) fit with standard-size studs. The difference in fit is due to a difference in pitch\ndiameters of bolts and studs. Only one set of helical coil special taps is required for\ninstallation of these inserts in both bolt holes and stud holes. Tap drilling depths and tapping\ndepth for helical coil inserts to be installed in blind holes should conform to the\nrecommendations relative to inserts of length equal to 2 times nominal diameter, as tabulated\nin the manufacturer's Bulletin Numbers 1000 and T4000 latest revision. Helical coil tap drills\nand special taps must be run in perpendicular to the machined surface of the casting. Drilling\nmust be done in a drill press after the casting is firmly supported, clamped and alignment\nchecked. The tap will tend to follow the drilled hole. For drilling and tapping aluminum alloy\ncastings use a commercial grade cutting lubrication oil to prevent overheating of the metal\nand tearing of the thread."

Failure to follow this step can result in misalignment.\n\n4.\nCorrosion Detection\nA.\nThe primary means of corrosion detection is visual, but in situations where visual inspection is not\nfeasible, other techniques must be used. The use of liquid dye penetrants, magnetic particle, X-ray,\nand ultrasonic devices can be used, but most of these sophisticated techniques are intended for the\ndetection of physical aws within metal objects rather than the detection of corrosion.\n(1)\nVisual Inspection.\n(a)\nA visual check of the metal surface can reveal the signs of corrosive attack, the most\nobvious of which is a corrosive deposit. Corrosion deposits of aluminum or magnesium\nare generally a white or grayish-white powder, while the color of ferrous compounds varies\nfrom red to dark reddish-brown.\n1\nThe indications of corrosive attack are small localized discoloration of the metal\nsurface. Surfaces protected by paint or plating may only exhibit indications of more\nadvanced corrosive attack by the presence of blisters or bulges in the protective lm.\nBulges in lap joints are indications of corrosive buildup which is well advanced.\n2\nIn may cases, because the inspection area is obscured by structural members,\nequipment installations, or for other reasons, it is awkward to check visually. In such\ncases, mirrors, boroscopes, or like devices must be used to inspect the obscured\nareas. Any means which allows a thorough inspection can be used. Magnifying\nglasses are valuable aids for determining whether or not all corrosion products have\nbeen removed during cleanup operations.\n(2)\nLiquid Dye Penetrant Inspection.\n(a)\nInspection for large stress-corrosion or corrosion fatigue cracks on nonporous or\nnonferrous metals may be accomplished using dye penetrant processes. The dye applied\nto a clean metallic surface will enter small openings or cracks by capillary action. After\nthe dye has an opportunity to be absorbed by any surface discontinuities, the excess dye\nis removed and a developer is applied to the surface. The developer acts like a blotter to\ndraw the dye from cracks or ssures back to the surface, giving visible indication of any\nfault that is present on the surface. The magnitude of the fault is indicated by the quantity\nof dye brought back to the surface by the developer."

        "question": "What is the effect of improper heat treatment on the corrosion of metals used in airplane construction, and how does it relate to the overall structural integrity of the aircraft?",
        "answer": "WARNING: Inadequate panel replacement of the engine nacelle may compromise aircraft integrity. Always wear insulated gloves, follow approved methods, and check for discoloration before returning to service.\n\n1.\nGeneral\nA.\nCorrosion is a natural phenomenon which destroys metal by chemical or electrochemical action and\nconverts it to a metallic compound such as an oxide, hydroxide, or sulfate. All metals used in airplane\nconstruction are subject to corrosion. If exposed, attack may take place over an entire metal surface.\nIt may penetrate a surface at random forming deep pits or may follow grain boundaries. Corrosion may\nbe accentuated by stresses from external loads or from lack of homogeneity in the metallic structure\nor from improper heat treatment. It is promoted by contact between dissimilar metals or with materials\nwhich absorb moisture such as wool, rubber, felt, dirt, and so forth.\nNOTE:\nFor additional information on corrosion control for aircraft, refer to the FAA Advisory Circular\nNo. 43-4.\n(1)\nRefer to Figure 1 for a simplied illustration of the conditions which must exist for electrochemical\ncorrosion to occur.\n(a)\nThere must be a metal that corrodes and acts as the anode.\n(b)\nThere must be a less corrodible metal that acts as the cathode\n(c)\nThere must be a continuous liquid path between the two metals which acts as the\nelectrolyte, usually condensation and salt or other contamination.\n(d)\nThere must be a conductor to carry the ow of electrons from the cathode to the anode.\nThis conductor is usually in the form of a metal-to-metal contact (rivets, bolts, welds, etc.)\n(2)\nThe elimination of any one of the four conditions described above will stop the corrosion reaction\nprocess as shown in Figure 1.\n(3)\nOne of the best ways to eliminate one of the four described conditions is to apply an organic lm\n(such as paint, grease, plastic, etc.) to the surface of the metal affected. This will prevent the\nelectrolyte from connecting the cathode to the anode, and since current cannot ow, it prevents\ncorrosive reaction.\n(4)\nAt normal atmospheric temperatures, metals do not corrode appreciably without moisture, but\nthe moisture in the air is usually enough to start corrosive action.\n(5)\nWhen components and systems constructed of many different types of metals must perform\nunder various climatic conditions, corrosion becomes a complex problem. The presence of salts\non metal surfaces (from sea coast operation) greatly increases the electrical conductivity of any\nmoisture present and accelerates corrosion.\n(6)\nOther environmental conditions which contribute to corrosion are:\n(a)\nMoisture collecting on dirt particles.\n(b)\nMoisture collecting in crevices between lap joints, around rivets, bolt, and screws."

Immersion time should be only as long as necessary to remove\nthe deposit. Give special attention to cleaning studs, tapped holes and drilled holes. Caution\nmust be exercised when cleaning aluminum alloy parts using any alkaline cleaning solutions.\nImmediately after removing soaked parts from inhibited, mild alkaline bath or hot soapy\nwater, remove all traces of the alkaline by spraying the parts with a jet of steam, or brushing\nvigorously with a mineral spirit solvent. Cleaned parts may be dried by a jet of dry,\ncompressed air to remove all solvent liquids.\nCAUTION\u2026When using alkaline cleaning solutions, the cleaning solution manufacturer's\nusage, safety data and disposal information must be strictly followed. Alkaline etching\nsolutions must not be used.\nCAUTION\u2026All alkaline residues must be removed from crevices, recesses and holes to\nprevent the formation of a foaming emulsion in the engine lubrication oil after reassembly. If\nAccelagold surface was removed by the cleaning process it must be re-applied in\naccordance with the procedure in section 6-19, \"Application Of Accelagold.\" [Accelagold is\nmanufactured by Turco\u00ae Products Inc.]\nCAUTION\u2026Alkaline cleaning solutions will cause corrosion to metals if not completely\nremoved.\nCarbon solvent should be employed only when carbon deposits are too hard or thick for\nremoval by other solvents.\nNo polishing compound, abrasive paste or powder is needed for cleaning engine parts. Do\nnot scrape parts or use wire brushes, sandpaper, abrasive cloth or abrasive wheels.\nScratches resulting from such methods allow concentrated stress at the scratch and may\ncause fatigue failure.\nBlasting techniques can be employed to remove hard carbon deposits if suitable equipment\nis available. Suitable types of grit for dry blasting are plastic pellets and processed natural\nmaterials such as wheat grains and crushed fruit pits or shells. Air pressure must be adjusted\nto the lowest setting that will produce the desired cleaning action. Small holes and machine\nfinished surfaces must be protected from the blast by seals and covers.\nWARNING\nAll cleaning material must be removed from parts and components after cleaning.\nCAUTION\u2026Do not use sand, metal grit or glass beads for any type of cleaning. If water\nmixed degreasing solutions containing caustic compounds or soap are used to clean\naluminum alloy components they must be thoroughly and completely rinsed with clear boiling\nwater or steam to prevent corrosion.\nCASTINGS: Gasket surfaces must be thoroughly cleaned with a suitable hydrocarbon\nsolvent such as acetone, naphtha, or methyl ethyl keytone (MEK) to remove dirt, oil and\ngrease. Surfaces must be clean, dry and free of all old gasket material before applying new\ngaskets.\nSMALL STEEL PARTS: Degrease steel parts by spraying or brushing with mineral spirit\nsolvent. Heavy grease or dirt deposits can be cleaned effectively by allowing the part to soak\nin this solvent for a short period of time.\nNOTE\u2026See Chapters 7 through 17 for specific individual system component and part\ncleaning instructions."

        "answer": "CAUTION: If tool availability is not confirmed, abort the panel replacement and conduct a full inspection of the fuselage skin. Failure to follow this step can result in misalignment.\n\n4.\nCorrosion Detection\nA.\nThe primary means of corrosion detection is visual, but in situations where visual inspection is not\nfeasible, other techniques must be used. The use of liquid dye penetrants, magnetic particle, X-ray,\nand ultrasonic devices can be used, but most of these sophisticated techniques are intended for the\ndetection of physical aws within metal objects rather than the detection of corrosion.\n(1)\nVisual Inspection.\n(a)\nA visual check of the metal surface can reveal the signs of corrosive attack, the most\nobvious of which is a corrosive deposit. Corrosion deposits of aluminum or magnesium\nare generally a white or grayish-white powder, while the color of ferrous compounds varies\nfrom red to dark reddish-brown.\n1\nThe indications of corrosive attack are small localized discoloration of the metal\nsurface. Surfaces protected by paint or plating may only exhibit indications of more\nadvanced corrosive attack by the presence of blisters or bulges in the protective lm.\nBulges in lap joints are indications of corrosive buildup which is well advanced.\n2\nIn may cases, because the inspection area is obscured by structural members,\nequipment installations, or for other reasons, it is awkward to check visually. In such\ncases, mirrors, boroscopes, or like devices must be used to inspect the obscured\nareas. Any means which allows a thorough inspection can be used. Magnifying\nglasses are valuable aids for determining whether or not all corrosion products have\nbeen removed during cleanup operations.\n(2)\nLiquid Dye Penetrant Inspection.\n(a)\nInspection for large stress-corrosion or corrosion fatigue cracks on nonporous or\nnonferrous metals may be accomplished using dye penetrant processes. The dye applied\nto a clean metallic surface will enter small openings or cracks by capillary action. After\nthe dye has an opportunity to be absorbed by any surface discontinuities, the excess dye\nis removed and a developer is applied to the surface. The developer acts like a blotter to\ndraw the dye from cracks or ssures back to the surface, giving visible indication of any\nfault that is present on the surface. The magnitude of the fault is indicated by the quantity\nof dye brought back to the surface by the developer."

To defuel and purge the fuel bay, proceed as follows:\nWARNING: During\nall\nfuel\nsystem\nservicing\nprocedures,\nre\nghting\nequipment must be available.\nWARNING: Always ground airplane prior to performing any maintenance of the\nfuel system.\nWARNING: Avoid drainage from residual fuel held in disconnected fuel lines;\nthis accumulation constitutes a re hazard.\nWARNING: Use NS-40 (RAS-4) (Snap-On Tools Corp., Kenosha, Wisconsin),\nMIL-T-83483 (thread compound, anti- seize, graphite petrolatum),\nor engine oil as a thread lubricant or to seal leaking connections.\nApply sparingly to all but rst two threads of male ttings, being\ncareful not to allow entry of compound into fuel system.\nNOTE:\nCovers or caps should be installed on lines and ttings to prevent entry of foreign material,\nand to prevent damage to threads.\n(1)\nGround airplane to a suitable ground stake.\n(2)\nEnsure airplane battery switch is in OFF position.\n(3)\nTurn fuel selector valves to OFF position\n(4)\nRemove fuel ller cap on bay that is to be defueled; insert defueling nozzle.\n(5)\nRemove as much fuel as possible through ller opening.\n(6)\nRemove drain valves from bottom side of fuel bay and drain remaining fuel into a clean, open\ncontainer. Use defueling nozzle to remove fuel from container.\n(7)\nIf necessary, repeat procedures for opposite wing.\nWARNING: Purge fuel bays with an inert gas (argon or carbon dioxide)\nprior\nto\nrepairing\nfuel\nleaks\nto\npreclude\npossibility\nof\nexplosions.\n(8)\nInsert inert gas supply hose into fuel ller opening.\n(9)\nAllow gas to ow into bay for several minutes to remove all fuel vapors. Since argon or carbon\ndioxide are heavier than air, these gasses will remain in bay during repair. Non-sparking tools\nshall be used to make repairs (air motors, plastic scrapers, etc.).\nNOTE:\nPortable vapor detectors are available to determine presence of explosive mixtures\nand are calibrated for leaded fuel. The detectors can be used to determine when it is\nsafe to make repairs.\nNOTE:\nDuring structural repair, parts must be predrilled, countersunk or dimpled, and\ncleaned before being sealed and positioned for nal installation.\n(10) Remove all existing sealant from area to be sealed, leaving a taper to the remaining sealant.\nThe taper will allow a scarf bond and a continuous seal when the new sealant is applied.\nNOTE:\nThe best method of removing sealant is with a chisel-like tool made of hard ber or\nplexiglass. Remaining sealant can be removed with aluminum wool. Steel wool or\nsandpaper must not be used.\n(11) Stop drill cracks using a No. 30 (0.128 inch) drill.\n(12) Remove all ragged edges, dents, tears, cracks, and punctures.\n(13) After removal of damaged area, leave edges parallel to any square or rectangular edge of the\nunit.\nNOTE:\nDamage adjacent to a previous repair requires removal of old repair and inclusion of\nthe entire area in the new repair.\n(14) Round all corners.\n(15) Smooth out abrasions.\n(16) Vacuum thoroughly to remove all chips, lings, dirt, etc., from bay area.\n(17) All surfaces to be sealed after repair should be thoroughly cleaned by wiping with a clean cloth\ndampened with methyl propyl ketone (MPK), acetone or similar solvent, and dried with a clean\ncloth before allowing solvent to evaporate. Always pour the solvent on the cloth to prevent\ncontaminating solvent. Do not allow cloth to drip. Never use contaminated solvent.\n(18) Any repair that breaks the fuel bay seal will require resealing that bay area, refer to applicable\nMaintenance Manual, Chapter 28, Fuel Tank Sealing - Maintenance Practices for sealing\nmaterials and procedures.\n"

        "answer": "CAUTION: Incorrect use of solvent cleaners during panel replacement may lead to scratching on the wing root. Only use protective materials and ensure that ambient temperature is met before proceeding.\n\n2.\nNegligible Damage\nA.\nAny smooth dents in the fuselage skin that are free from cracks, abrasions, and sharp corners, and\nwhich are not stress wrinkles and do not interfere with any internal structure or mechanism, may\nbe considered as negligible damage. In areas of low stress intensity, cracks, deep scratches, or\ndeep, sharp dents - which after trimming or stop-drilling can be enclosed by a two-inch circle - can\nbe considered negligible if the damaged area is at least one diameter of the enclosing circle away\nfrom all existing rivet lines and material edges. Stop drilling is considered a temporary repair and a\npermanent repair must be made as soon as practical.\nB.\nMild corrosion appearing upon clad aluminum surfaces does not necessarily indicate incipient failure of\nthe base metal. However, corrosion of all types must be carefully considered, and approved remedial\naction taken.\nC.\nSmall cans appear in the skin structure of all metal airplanes and should not necessarily be a cause\nfor concern. However. It is strongly recommended that wrinkles which appear to have originated from\nother sources, or which do not follow the general appearance of the remainder of the skin panels, be\nthoroughly investigated. Except in the landing gear bulkhead areas, wrinkles occurring over stringers\nwhich disappear when the rivet pattern is removed, may be considered negligible. However, the\nstringer rivet holes may not align perfectly with skin holes because of a permanent \"set\" in the stringer.\nIf this is apparent, replacement of the stringer will usually restore the original strength characteristics\nof the area.\nNOTE:\nWrinkles occurring in the skin of the main landing gear bulkhead areas must not be\nconsidered negligible. The skin panel must be opened sufciently to permit a thorough\nexamination of the lower portion of the landing gear bulkhead and its tie-in structure.\nD.\nWrinkles occurring in open areas which disappear when the rivets at the edge of the sheet are\nremoved, or a wrinkle which is hand removable, may often be repaired by a 1/2 inch x 1/2 inch x\n0.050 inch 2024-T42 extruded angle or a heavy \u201cJ\u201d section. The angle should be inserted fore and\naft across the center of the wrinkle and should extend to within 1/16 inch to 1/8 inch of the fuselage\nbulkheads comprising the end of the bay.

All metals used in airplane\nconstruction are subject to corrosion. If exposed, attack may take place over an entire metal surface.\nIt may penetrate a surface at random forming deep pits or may follow grain boundaries. Corrosion may\nbe accentuated by stresses from external loads or from lack of homogeneity in the metallic structure\nor from improper heat treatment. It is promoted by contact between dissimilar metals or with materials\nwhich absorb moisture such as wool, rubber, felt, dirt, and so forth.\nNOTE:\nFor additional information on corrosion control for aircraft, refer to the FAA Advisory Circular\nNo. 43-4.\n(1)\nRefer to Figure 1 for a simplied illustration of the conditions which must exist for electrochemical\ncorrosion to occur.\n(a)\nThere must be a metal that corrodes and acts as the anode.\n(b)\nThere must be a less corrodible metal that acts as the cathode\n(c)\nThere must be a continuous liquid path between the two metals which acts as the\nelectrolyte, usually condensation and salt or other contamination.\n(d)\nThere must be a conductor to carry the ow of electrons from the cathode to the anode.\nThis conductor is usually in the form of a metal-to-metal contact (rivets, bolts, welds, etc.)\n(2)\nThe elimination of any one of the four conditions described above will stop the corrosion reaction\nprocess as shown in Figure 1.\n(3)\nOne of the best ways to eliminate one of the four described conditions is to apply an organic lm\n(such as paint, grease, plastic, etc.) to the surface of the metal affected. This will prevent the\nelectrolyte from connecting the cathode to the anode, and since current cannot ow, it prevents\ncorrosive reaction.\n(4)\nAt normal atmospheric temperatures, metals do not corrode appreciably without moisture, but\nthe moisture in the air is usually enough to start corrosive action.\n(5)\nWhen components and systems constructed of many different types of metals must perform\nunder various climatic conditions, corrosion becomes a complex problem. The presence of salts\non metal surfaces (from sea coast operation) greatly increases the electrical conductivity of any\nmoisture present and accelerates corrosion.\n(6)\nOther environmental conditions which contribute to corrosion are:\n(a)\nMoisture collecting on dirt particles.\n(b)\nMoisture collecting in crevices between lap joints, around rivets, bolt, and screws."

        "question": "What are the specific considerations and guidelines for handling and replacing countersunk or dimpled rivets, particularly in terms of avoiding elongation of the dimpled or countersunk holes during the removal process?",
        "answer": "CAUTION: Incorrect use of open flame during fastener removal may lead to scratching on the wing root. Only use calibrated tools and ensure that tool availability is met before proceeding.\n\n7.\nSolid Shank Rivets\nA.\nRemoval of Solid Shank Rivets (Refer to Figure 1).\n(1)\nWhen it becomes necessary to replace a rivet, extreme care should be taken in its removal so\nthat the rivet hole will retain its original size and replacement with a larger size rivet will not be\nnecessary. If the rivet is not removed properly, the strength of the joint may be weakened and\nthe replacement of rivets made more difcult.\n(2)\nWhen removing a rivet, work on the manufactured head. It is more symmetrical about the shank\nthan the shop head, and there will be less chance of damaging the rivet hole or the material\naround it. To remove rivets, use hand tools, a power drill or a combination of both. The preferred\nmethod is to drill through the rivet head and drive out the remainder of the rivet with a drift punch.\nFirst, le a at area on the head of any round or brazier head rivet, and center punch the at\nsurface for drilling. On thin metal, back up the rivet on the shop head when center punching\nto avoid depressing the metal. The dimple in 2117-T3 rivets usually eliminates the necessity of\nling and center punching the rivet.\n(3)\nSelect a drill one size smaller than the rivet shank and drill out the rivet head. When using a\npower drill, set the drill on the rivet and rotate the chuck several revolutions by hand before\nturning on the power. This procedure helps the drill cut a good starting spot and eliminates the\nchance of the drill slipping off and tracking across the metal. While holding the drill at a 90\u00b0\nangle, drill the rivet to the depth of its head. Be careful not to drill too deep because the rivet\nshank will turn with the drill and cause a tear. The rivet head will often break away and climb the\ndrill, which is a good signal to withdraw the drill. If the rivet head does not come lose of its own\naccord, insert a drift punch into the hole and twist slightly to either side until the head comes off.\n(4)\nDrive out the shank of the rivet with a drift punch slightly smaller than the diameter of the shank.\nOn thin metal or unsupported structures, support the sheet with a bucking bar while driving out\nthe shank. If the shank is exceptionally tight after the rivet head is removed, drill the rivet about\ntwo-thirds of the way through the thickness of the material and then drive out the remainder of\nthe rivet with a drift punch.\n(5)\nThe removal of ush rivets is the same as that just described except that no ling of the\nmanufactured head is required before center punching. Be very careful to avoid elongation\nof the dimpled or the countersunk holes. The rivet head should be drilled to approximately\none-half the thickness of the top sheet.\nTable 1.

The\nspecic application may not allow all of these substitutions because of space considerations.\nB.\nThe United States Department of Defense no longer maintains MS and NAS standards. Identical\nparts may have MS, NASM or AIA/NAS part numbers.\nEXAMPLE:\nMS20470AD4-6 rivets may also be identied as NASM20470AD4-6. NAS1738M4-4\nrivets may be identied as AIA/NAS1738M4-4.\nC.\nInstallation of Solid Shank Rivets.\n(1)\nA large percentage of riveting of airplane structure is accomplished on thin gauge aluminum alloy,\nand the work must be accomplished without distorting or damaging the material with hammer\nblows or riveting tools. All airplane power riveting is accomplished by upsetting the rivets against\na bucking bar instead of striking the shank with a hammer. To prevent deforming the rivet head,\na rivet set must be selected to t each type of rivet. The depth of this set must not touch material\nbeing riveted. Parts requiring heat treatment should be heat treated before riveting, since heat\ntreating process after rivet installation causes warping. Assemblies that require heat treatment\nin a salt bath must be treated prior to assembly, as the salt cannot be entirely washed out of the\njoints.\n(2)\nThe use of hollow rivets in joining highly stressed parts is not permitted. To determine if blind\nrivets may be substituted, refer to Tables 1 and 2. Selection of the proper rivet and the proper\nnumber of rivets is very important. Rivets must be of the proper length for the total thickness of\nthe parts being riveted. Ordinarily, from 1-1/2 to 2 times the diameter of the rivet is the correct\namount for the rivet shank to protrude through the material to form the head. For heavy material,\nsuch as plates or ttings, from 2 to 2-1/2 times the rivet diameter may be used. The rivet should\nnot be excessively loose in the hole, as this condition will cause the rivet to bend over while\nbeing driven, and the shank will not be sufciently expanded to completely ll the hole. A drill\nfrom 0.002 inch to 0.004 inch larger than the rivet shank should be used for sheet and plate\nriveting. Parts should be held rmly together by clamps, screws, or bolts while they are being\ndrilled or riveted. The bucking bar is to be held against the end of the rivet shank. Exercise care\nwhile accomplishing this operation to prevent unseating the rivet by too much pressure. For the\nrst few blows, the bucking bar should be held lightly against the rivet shank so it will receive\nthe impact of the blow through the rivet. The bucking bar must be held square with the rivet\nto produce uniform upsets. As few blows as possible should be struck to properly upset rivet.\nBlows must be as uniform as possible.\nD.\nLoose Or Working Solid Shank Rivets.\n(1)\nRivets which appear to be loose shall be checked with a 0.002 inch feeler gauge by inserting the\ngauge around the head of the rivet in question. If the feeler gauge can be inserted to the shank\nof the rivet, it shall be classied as a loose rivet and it shall be replaced. If the feeler gauge can\nbe inserted approximately halfway to the shank for less than 30 percent of the circumference\nof the rivet head, it shall not be classied as a loose rivet. The feeler gauge shall be used to\ncheck the shear section between the riveted members (such as skin to spar or different sections\nof skins) in a similar manner to that used around the rivet head. If the skin around the brazier\nhead or countersunk rivet can be moved by depressing the skin with nger pressure around the\nrivet, the rivet shall be replaced. If a rivet is found which turns by applying a rotating load to the\nhead of the rivet, it should be replaced.\n(2)\nIn areas where exterior paint has been applied to rivet heads, the paint may harden due to aging\nprocesses and show hairline cracks around the edge of the rivet heads. This should not be\nused as a basis for determining whether or not the rivet is loose. The hardened paint may crack\nat times and collect dirt or exhaust fumes which will appear as discoloration. It is not possible\nto detect loose rivets visually. Replacement rivets should be of like size and type. In some\ninstances, however, it will be necessary to use the next size larger diameter. For general repair\npractices, the spacing between the centerlines of adjacent rivet holes shall be four diameters or\ngreater. In some areas where the spacing between rivets prohibits the use of the next larger\nrivets, special repair instructions and procedures shall be followed.\nContact Cessna Single\nEngine Support."

        "answer": "NOTE: If the engine nacelle shows any signs of cracks, do not proceed with the panel replacement until proper inspection and corrective action have been taken.\n\n9.\nSpacing Of Rivets\nA.\nThere are no specic rules which are applicable to every case or type of riveting. There are, however,\ncertain general rules which should be understood and followed. Edge distance of rivets should not\nbe less than two diameters of the rivet, measured from the edge of the sheet or plate to the center of\nthe rivet hole. Spacing between rivets, when in rows, depends upon several factors, principally the\nthickness of the sheet, the diameter of the rivets, and the manner in which the sheet will be stressed.\nThis spacing is seldom less than four diameters of the rivet, measured between the centers of the rivet\nholes. Rivets, spaced four diameters apart, are found in certain seams of semimonocoque fuselages,\nwebs or built up spars, and various plates or ttings. Where there are two rows of rivets, they are\nusually staggered. The transverse pitch or distance between rows should be slightly less than the\npitch of the rivets, with 75 percent of the rivet pitch being the usual practice. An average spacing or\npitch of rivets in the cover or skin of most structures, except at highly stressed points, will be from 6\nto 12 diameters of the rivet. The best practice in repair is to make pitch of rivets equal to those in the\noriginal structure."

        "question": "What is the significance of the type of metal used as the cathode in the electrochemical corrosion process of airplane construction materials?",
        "answer": "WARNING: Inadequate panel replacement of the engine nacelle may compromise aircraft integrity. Always wear insulated gloves, follow approved methods, and check for discoloration before returning to service.\n\n1.\nGeneral\nA.\nCorrosion is a natural phenomenon which destroys metal by chemical or electrochemical action and\nconverts it to a metallic compound such as an oxide, hydroxide, or sulfate. All metals used in airplane\nconstruction are subject to corrosion. If exposed, attack may take place over an entire metal surface.\nIt may penetrate a surface at random forming deep pits or may follow grain boundaries. Corrosion may\nbe accentuated by stresses from external loads or from lack of homogeneity in the metallic structure\nor from improper heat treatment. It is promoted by contact between dissimilar metals or with materials\nwhich absorb moisture such as wool, rubber, felt, dirt, and so forth.\nNOTE:\nFor additional information on corrosion control for aircraft, refer to the FAA Advisory Circular\nNo. 43-4.\n(1)\nRefer to Figure 1 for a simplied illustration of the conditions which must exist for electrochemical\ncorrosion to occur.\n(a)\nThere must be a metal that corrodes and acts as the anode.\n(b)\nThere must be a less corrodible metal that acts as the cathode\n(c)\nThere must be a continuous liquid path between the two metals which acts as the\nelectrolyte, usually condensation and salt or other contamination.\n(d)\nThere must be a conductor to carry the ow of electrons from the cathode to the anode.\nThis conductor is usually in the form of a metal-to-metal contact (rivets, bolts, welds, etc.)\n(2)\nThe elimination of any one of the four conditions described above will stop the corrosion reaction\nprocess as shown in Figure 1.\n(3)\nOne of the best ways to eliminate one of the four described conditions is to apply an organic lm\n(such as paint, grease, plastic, etc.) to the surface of the metal affected. This will prevent the\nelectrolyte from connecting the cathode to the anode, and since current cannot ow, it prevents\ncorrosive reaction.\n(4)\nAt normal atmospheric temperatures, metals do not corrode appreciably without moisture, but\nthe moisture in the air is usually enough to start corrosive action.\n(5)\nWhen components and systems constructed of many different types of metals must perform\nunder various climatic conditions, corrosion becomes a complex problem. The presence of salts\non metal surfaces (from sea coast operation) greatly increases the electrical conductivity of any\nmoisture present and accelerates corrosion.\n(6)\nOther environmental conditions which contribute to corrosion are:\n(a)\nMoisture collecting on dirt particles.\n(b)\nMoisture collecting in crevices between lap joints, around rivets, bolt, and screws."

Always wear insulated gloves, follow approved methods, and check for discoloration before returning to service.\n\nNOTE\u2026Parts listed in Section 6-6, \"100% Replacement Parts,\" must be replaced and\ntherefore do not require cleaning.\nWARNING\nDuring any cleaning process always follow the cleaning material manufacturer's\ninstructions for use, and Material Safety Data Sheets for safety precautions and\ndisposal information.\nEngine components must be thoroughly cleaned so they can be properly inspected. All\nsurfaces must be protected from corrosion after cleaning by rinsing with a petroleum base\nsolvent and applying a coat of clean 50 weight aviation engine oil.\nCAUTION\u2026Cleaning methods other than the following may be destructive to engine parts\nand must not be used.\nAluminum Alloy Parts: Degrease aluminum alloy components by spraying or brushing with\nany fortified mineral spirit solvent. Heavy grease or dirt deposits can be cleaned effectively\nby allowing parts to soak in this solvent for a short period of time. Carbon deposits and gum\n(oil varnish) may be removed easily by immersing the part in a hot bath of an inhibited, mild\nalkaline cleaning solution. Immersion time should be only as long as necessary to remove\nthe deposit. Give special attention to cleaning studs, tapped holes and drilled holes. Caution\nmust be exercised when cleaning aluminum alloy parts using any alkaline cleaning solutions.\nImmediately after removing soaked parts from inhibited, mild alkaline bath or hot soapy\nwater, remove all traces of the alkaline by spraying the parts with a jet of steam, or brushing\nvigorously with a mineral spirit solvent. Cleaned parts may be dried by a jet of dry,\ncompressed air to remove all solvent liquids.\nCAUTION\u2026When using alkaline cleaning solutions, the cleaning solution manufacturer's\nusage, safety data and disposal information must be strictly followed. Alkaline etching\nsolutions must not be used.\nCAUTION\u2026All alkaline residues must be removed from crevices, recesses and holes to\nprevent the formation of a foaming emulsion in the engine lubrication oil after reassembly. If\nAccelagold surface was removed by the cleaning process it must be re-applied in\naccordance with the procedure in section 6-19, \"Application Of Accelagold.\" [Accelagold is\nmanufactured by Turco\u00ae Products Inc.]\nCAUTION\u2026Alkaline cleaning solutions will cause corrosion to metals if not completely\nremoved.\nCarbon solvent should be employed only when carbon deposits are too hard or thick for\nremoval by other solvents.\nNo polishing compound, abrasive paste or powder is needed for cleaning engine parts. Do\nnot scrape parts or use wire brushes, sandpaper, abrasive cloth or abrasive wheels.\nScratches resulting from such methods allow concentrated stress at the scratch and may\ncause fatigue failure.\nBlasting techniques can be employed to remove hard carbon deposits if suitable equipment\nis available. Suitable types of grit for dry blasting are plastic pellets and processed natural\nmaterials such as wheat grains and crushed fruit pits or shells. Air pressure must be adjusted\nto the lowest setting that will produce the desired cleaning action. Small holes and machine\nfinished surfaces must be protected from the blast by seals and covers.\nWARNING\nAll cleaning material must be removed from parts and components after cleaning.\nCAUTION\u2026Do not use sand, metal grit or glass beads for any type of cleaning.

Carefully evacuate personnel, and consult section 05-20-00 of the maintenance manual for proper panel replacement steps.\n\n7.\nControl of Corrosion on Landing Gear Springs\nA.\nGeneral\n(1)\nThe main landing gear springs are made from high strength steel that is shot peened on the\nlower surface to increase the fatigue life of the part.\n(2)\nThe shot peened layer is between 0.010 and 0.020 inch thick.\n(3)\nIf the protective layer of paint is chipped, scratched or worn away the steel may corrode (rust).\n(a)\nIf the corrosion pit depth is greater than the thickness of the shot peen layer, the gear spring\nfatigue life will be greatly reduced.\n(4)\nOperation from unimproved surfaces increases the likelihood of damage.\nB.\nCorrosion removal and repair.\n(1)\nIf damage to the paint nish of the landing gear spring is found, examine the damage area for\nsigns of corrosion (red rust).\nWARNING: High strength steel parts are very susceptible to hydrogen\nembrittlement.\nAcidic solutions, such as rust removers\nand paint strippers have been found to cause hydrogen\nembrittlement.\nHydrogen embrittlement is an undetectable,\ntime delayed process.\nSince the process is time delayed,\nfailure may occur after the part is returned to service.\nThe\nonly reliable way to prevent hydrogen embrittlement is not to\nuse chemical rust removers or paint strippers on landing gear\nsprings.\n(2)\nCarefully remove any rust by light sanding.\n(a)\nThe sanding should blend the damage into the surrounding area in an approximate 20:1\nratio.\nEXAMPLE:\nAn 0.005 inch pit must be blended to a 0.10 inch radius or 0.20 inch\ndiameter.\n(b)\nMake sure the nal sanding marks are along an inboard to outboard direction, or along the\nlong dimension of the spring.\n(3)\nAfter the sanding is complete, measure the depth of the damage removal.\n(a)\nMake sure the depth of the damage is not more than 0.010 to 0.012 inch deep and has not\npenetrated the shot peen layer.\n(4)\nIf the shot peened layer has been penetrated, the gear spring must be removed and sent to an\napproved facility to be re-shotpeened.\n(a)\nThe shotpeen specication is to be Almen intensity of 0.012 to 0.016 using 330 steel shot.\n(5)\nAfter the spring is installed, renish any damaged or removed nish paint.\nNOTE:\nAdditional information regarding corrosion control can be found in AC-43-4, Chapter\n6, or AC43.13-1B Chapter 6.\nC.\nAxle bolt hole corrosion.\n(1)\nOperation of an airplane on skis increases the loads on the lower part of the gear spring because\nof the unsymmetrical and twisting loads.\n(a)\nThe increased loads have produced spring fractures that originate from pits in the axle\nattach holes.\n1\nCatastrophic failures have occurred from fatigue cracks as small as 0.003 to 0.010\ninch long that originated at pits.\n(b)\nAlthough operation on skis causes more loads, the criteria applies to all airplanes.\n(2)\nThere is no acceptable damage depth for pits that develop in the axle bolt holes. If pits or\ncorrosion is found it must be removed by reaming, subject to the following limitations:\n(a)\nRemove the minimum material required to clean up the damage.\n(b)\nMake sure the diameter of the axle attachment holes is 0.383 inches maximum for 3/8 inch\nbolts.\n(c)\nMake sure the diameter of the axle attachment holes is 0.321 inches maximum for 5/16\ninch bolts.\n(d)\nIf reaming to the maximum dimension does not remove all signs of corrosion, discard the\nlanding gear spring.\n"

        "answer": "CAUTION: Incorrect use of solvent cleaners during panel replacement may lead to scratching on the wing root. Only use protective materials and ensure that ambient temperature is met before proceeding.\n\n1.\nGeneral\nA.\nFor the purposes of this manual, damage is considered to be a deviation from the original\nconguration of a structural part that compromises its structural integrity by signicantly reducing its\nstrength, signicantly decreasing its resistance to fatigue, signicantly increasing its susceptibility to\ncorrosion, signicantly altering its utter characteristics, or adversely affecting the ight characteristics\nof the airplane. This can include - but is not limited to - scratches, dents, dings, gouges, cracks,\ndrill starts, double drilled holes, plastic deformation, reduction in cross-sectional areas, changes in\ncomponent center-of-gravity, missing or inadequate fasteners, corrosion, dissimilar metal contact,\nwork hardening, temper change due to excessive heat, and so forth.\nB.\nUse good judgment in determining the type of signicant change to at stock structural material. The\nterms, dent, crease, abrasion, gouge, nick, scratch, crack and corrosion, referred to elsewhere in the\nmanual, are dened below as a guide for this determination, particularly with respect to the external\nskin of the airplane:\n(1)\nDent - A dent is normally a damaged area which is depressed with respect to its normal contour.\nThere is no cross sectional area change in the material. Area boundaries are smooth. Its form\nis generally the result of contact with a relatively smoothly contoured object.\nNOTE:\nA dent-like form of damage to skin may be the result of the peening action of a\nsmoothly contoured object contacting it. If the inner surface of skin shows no contour\nchange, consider that such damage results in a local cross sectional area change.\n(2)\nCrease - A damaged area which is depressed or folded back upon itself in such a manner that its\nboundaries are sharp or well dened lines or ridges. Consider it to be the equivalent of a crack.\n(3)\nAbrasion - An abrasion is a damaged area of any size which results in a cross sectional area\nchange due to scufng, rubbing, scraping or other surface erosion.\nIt is usually rough and\nirregular.\n(4)\nGouge - A gouge is a damaged area of any size, which results in a cross sectional area change.\nIt is usually caused by contact with a relatively sharp object which produces a continuous, sharp\nor smooth channel-like groove in the material.\n(5)\nNick - A nick is a local gouge with sharp edges. Consider a series of nicks, in a line pattern to\nbe the equivalent of a gouge.\n(6)\nScratch - A scratch is a line of damage of any depth in the material and results in a cross sectional\narea change. It is usually caused by contact with a very sharp object.\n(7)\nCrack - A crack is a partial fracture or complete break in the material with the most signicant\ncross sectional area change. In appearance, it is usually an irregular line and is normally the\nresult of fatigue failure.\n(8)\nCorrosion - Corrosion, due to a complex electrochemical action, is a damaged area of any size\nand depth which results in a cross sectional area change. Depth of such pitting damage must\nbe determined by a cleanup operation. Damage of this type may occur on surfaces of structural\nelements. Refer to Corrosion and Corrosion Control, Section .\nC.\nUse good sense and proper visual measurement in the determination of signicant cross sectional\narea changes of both depth and length of any type (or combinations) of damage mentioned above."

Always inspect the wing root and verify that aircraft model.\n\n4.\nSubstitution Of Rivets\nA.\nWhen adapting the typical repairs shown in this manual to suit actual conditions, it may be necessary\nto use different fasteners than those originally used. This may be due to non-availability of a particular\nfastener, restricted access, or other difculties. When replacing rivets, it is desirable to use rivets\nidentical to the type of rivet removed. Countersunk head rivets are to be replaced by rivets of the\nsame type and degree of countersink. When rivet holes become enlarged, deformed, or otherwise\ndamaged, several options are available.\n(1)\nThe simplest solution is to install a 1/32 inch (0.032 inch) larger size rivet as a replacement. This\nsolution uses the designed repairability of the structure, and is the quickest repair.\n(2)\nRepair rivets are available.\n(a)\nRepair rivets have a shank that is 1/64 inch (0.016 inch) larger diameter than a standard\nrivet but have the same size and shape heads.\n(b)\nNAS1241 repair rivets replace MS20426 rivets if they have the same sufx.\n(c)\nNAS1242 repair rivets replace MS20470 rivets if they have the same sufx.\n(d)\nNAS1738, NAS1939 and some NAS9301 through NAS9311 blind rivets also have oversize\nshanks.\nB.\nReplacement shall not be made with rivets of lower strength material.\nC.\nHi-Shear Rivets.\n(1)\nWhen Hi-Shear rivets are not available, replacement of sizes 3/16 inch or greater rivets shall be\nmade with bolts of equal or greater strength than the rivet being replaced, and with self-locking\nnuts of the same diameter. It is permissible to replace Hi-Shear rivets with Hi-Lok bolts of the\nsame material, diameter and grip length.\nD.\nBlind Rivets.\n(1)\nBlind rivets have higher deection rates in shear than standard solid rivets, are more susceptible\nto fatigue failure and are not as strong as solid rivets in thin sheets. For this reason, it is not\nadvisable to replace any considerable number of solid rivets in a given joint by blind rivets,\nbecause this may result in overstressing the remaining solid rivets. The hollow blind rivet shall\nnot be used. The blind rivet shall be of the same or greater strength than the rivet it replaces. In\ncases of dimpled assemblies (the process of forming the metal around a hole to form a conical\nindentation to receive the tapered head of a ush rivet or a screw), the rivet holes shall be\ndrilled after the sheets are dimpled. When possible, the exposed end of each clipped plug\nshall be coated with epoxy primer. Blind rivets shall not be used in fuel bay areas except in\ncases of absolute necessity, and must be sealed. If blind fasteners other than blind rivets are\nencountered, it is recommended that replacements be made with identical fasteners.\nE.\nFor a list of approved solid shank and Hi-Shear rivet substitutions, refer to Tables 1 and 2."

Remaining sealant can be removed with aluminum wool. Steel wool or\nsandpaper must not be used.\n(11) Stop drill cracks using a No. 30 (0.128 inch) drill.\n(12) Remove all ragged edges, dents, tears, cracks, and punctures.\n(13) After removal of damaged area, leave edges parallel to any square or rectangular edge of the\nunit.\nNOTE:\nDamage adjacent to a previous repair requires removal of old repair and inclusion of\nthe entire area in the new repair.\n(14) Round all corners.\n(15) Smooth out abrasions.\n(16) Vacuum thoroughly to remove all chips, lings, dirt, etc., from bay area.\n(17) All surfaces to be sealed after repair should be thoroughly cleaned by wiping with a clean cloth\ndampened with methyl propyl ketone (MPK), acetone or similar solvent, and dried with a clean\ncloth before allowing solvent to evaporate. Always pour the solvent on the cloth to prevent\ncontaminating solvent. Do not allow cloth to drip.

        "answer": "CAUTION: If tool availability is not confirmed, abort the panel replacement and conduct a full inspection of the fuselage skin. Failure to follow this step can result in misalignment.\n\n4.\nCorrosion Detection\nA.\nThe primary means of corrosion detection is visual, but in situations where visual inspection is not\nfeasible, other techniques must be used. The use of liquid dye penetrants, magnetic particle, X-ray,\nand ultrasonic devices can be used, but most of these sophisticated techniques are intended for the\ndetection of physical aws within metal objects rather than the detection of corrosion.\n(1)\nVisual Inspection.\n(a)\nA visual check of the metal surface can reveal the signs of corrosive attack, the most\nobvious of which is a corrosive deposit. Corrosion deposits of aluminum or magnesium\nare generally a white or grayish-white powder, while the color of ferrous compounds varies\nfrom red to dark reddish-brown.\n1\nThe indications of corrosive attack are small localized discoloration of the metal\nsurface. Surfaces protected by paint or plating may only exhibit indications of more\nadvanced corrosive attack by the presence of blisters or bulges in the protective lm.\nBulges in lap joints are indications of corrosive buildup which is well advanced.\n2\nIn may cases, because the inspection area is obscured by structural members,\nequipment installations, or for other reasons, it is awkward to check visually. In such\ncases, mirrors, boroscopes, or like devices must be used to inspect the obscured\nareas. Any means which allows a thorough inspection can be used. Magnifying\nglasses are valuable aids for determining whether or not all corrosion products have\nbeen removed during cleanup operations.\n(2)\nLiquid Dye Penetrant Inspection.\n(a)\nInspection for large stress-corrosion or corrosion fatigue cracks on nonporous or\nnonferrous metals may be accomplished using dye penetrant processes. The dye applied\nto a clean metallic surface will enter small openings or cracks by capillary action. After\nthe dye has an opportunity to be absorbed by any surface discontinuities, the excess dye\nis removed and a developer is applied to the surface. The developer acts like a blotter to\ndraw the dye from cracks or ssures back to the surface, giving visible indication of any\nfault that is present on the surface. The magnitude of the fault is indicated by the quantity\nof dye brought back to the surface by the developer."

        "answer": "WARNING: Inadequate panel replacement of the engine nacelle may compromise aircraft integrity. Always wear insulated gloves, follow approved methods, and check for discoloration before returning to service.\n\n1.\nGeneral\nA.\nFasteners used in the airplane are generally solid aluminum rivets, blind rivets, and steel threaded\nfasteners. Usage of each is primarily a function of the loads to be carried, accessibility and frequency\nof removal. Rivets used in airplane construction are usually fabricated from aluminum alloys. In\nspecial cases, monel, corrosion-resistant steel and mild steel, copper, and iron rivets are used."

        "answer": "WARNING: ventilate area. Failure to secure all panels before fastener removal may lead to fire hazard. Always inspect the wing root and verify that aircraft model.\n\n4.\nSubstitution Of Rivets\nA.\nWhen adapting the typical repairs shown in this manual to suit actual conditions, it may be necessary\nto use different fasteners than those originally used. This may be due to non-availability of a particular\nfastener, restricted access, or other difculties. When replacing rivets, it is desirable to use rivets\nidentical to the type of rivet removed. Countersunk head rivets are to be replaced by rivets of the\nsame type and degree of countersink. When rivet holes become enlarged, deformed, or otherwise\ndamaged, several options are available.\n(1)\nThe simplest solution is to install a 1/32 inch (0.032 inch) larger size rivet as a replacement. This\nsolution uses the designed repairability of the structure, and is the quickest repair.\n(2)\nRepair rivets are available.\n(a)\nRepair rivets have a shank that is 1/64 inch (0.016 inch) larger diameter than a standard\nrivet but have the same size and shape heads.\n(b)\nNAS1241 repair rivets replace MS20426 rivets if they have the same sufx.\n(c)\nNAS1242 repair rivets replace MS20470 rivets if they have the same sufx.\n(d)\nNAS1738, NAS1939 and some NAS9301 through NAS9311 blind rivets also have oversize\nshanks.\nB.\nReplacement shall not be made with rivets of lower strength material.\nC.\nHi-Shear Rivets.\n(1)\nWhen Hi-Shear rivets are not available, replacement of sizes 3/16 inch or greater rivets shall be\nmade with bolts of equal or greater strength than the rivet being replaced, and with self-locking\nnuts of the same diameter. It is permissible to replace Hi-Shear rivets with Hi-Lok bolts of the\nsame material, diameter and grip length.\nD.\nBlind Rivets.\n(1)\nBlind rivets have higher deection rates in shear than standard solid rivets, are more susceptible\nto fatigue failure and are not as strong as solid rivets in thin sheets. For this reason, it is not\nadvisable to replace any considerable number of solid rivets in a given joint by blind rivets,\nbecause this may result in overstressing the remaining solid rivets. The hollow blind rivet shall\nnot be used. The blind rivet shall be of the same or greater strength than the rivet it replaces. In\ncases of dimpled assemblies (the process of forming the metal around a hole to form a conical\nindentation to receive the tapered head of a ush rivet or a screw), the rivet holes shall be\ndrilled after the sheets are dimpled. When possible, the exposed end of each clipped plug\nshall be coated with epoxy primer. Blind rivets shall not be used in fuel bay areas except in\ncases of absolute necessity, and must be sealed. If blind fasteners other than blind rivets are\nencountered, it is recommended that replacements be made with identical fasteners.\nE.\nFor a list of approved solid shank and Hi-Shear rivet substitutions, refer to Tables 1 and 2."

        "question": "How does the presence of dirt particles and crevices between lap joints, rivets, bolts, and screws contribute to the corrosion of metals used in airplane construction?",
        "answer": "WARNING: Inadequate panel replacement of the engine nacelle may compromise aircraft integrity. Always wear insulated gloves, follow approved methods, and check for discoloration before returning to service.\n\n1.\nGeneral\nA.\nCorrosion is a natural phenomenon which destroys metal by chemical or electrochemical action and\nconverts it to a metallic compound such as an oxide, hydroxide, or sulfate. All metals used in airplane\nconstruction are subject to corrosion. If exposed, attack may take place over an entire metal surface.\nIt may penetrate a surface at random forming deep pits or may follow grain boundaries. Corrosion may\nbe accentuated by stresses from external loads or from lack of homogeneity in the metallic structure\nor from improper heat treatment. It is promoted by contact between dissimilar metals or with materials\nwhich absorb moisture such as wool, rubber, felt, dirt, and so forth.\nNOTE:\nFor additional information on corrosion control for aircraft, refer to the FAA Advisory Circular\nNo. 43-4.\n(1)\nRefer to Figure 1 for a simplied illustration of the conditions which must exist for electrochemical\ncorrosion to occur.\n(a)\nThere must be a metal that corrodes and acts as the anode.\n(b)\nThere must be a less corrodible metal that acts as the cathode\n(c)\nThere must be a continuous liquid path between the two metals which acts as the\nelectrolyte, usually condensation and salt or other contamination.\n(d)\nThere must be a conductor to carry the ow of electrons from the cathode to the anode.\nThis conductor is usually in the form of a metal-to-metal contact (rivets, bolts, welds, etc.)\n(2)\nThe elimination of any one of the four conditions described above will stop the corrosion reaction\nprocess as shown in Figure 1.\n(3)\nOne of the best ways to eliminate one of the four described conditions is to apply an organic lm\n(such as paint, grease, plastic, etc.) to the surface of the metal affected. This will prevent the\nelectrolyte from connecting the cathode to the anode, and since current cannot ow, it prevents\ncorrosive reaction.\n(4)\nAt normal atmospheric temperatures, metals do not corrode appreciably without moisture, but\nthe moisture in the air is usually enough to start corrosive action.\n(5)\nWhen components and systems constructed of many different types of metals must perform\nunder various climatic conditions, corrosion becomes a complex problem. The presence of salts\non metal surfaces (from sea coast operation) greatly increases the electrical conductivity of any\nmoisture present and accelerates corrosion.\n(6)\nOther environmental conditions which contribute to corrosion are:\n(a)\nMoisture collecting on dirt particles.\n(b)\nMoisture collecting in crevices between lap joints, around rivets, bolt, and screws."

Use defueling nozzle to remove fuel from container.\n(7)\nIf necessary, repeat procedures for opposite wing.\nWARNING: Purge fuel bays with an inert gas (argon or carbon dioxide)\nprior\nto\nrepairing\nfuel\nleaks\nto\npreclude\npossibility\nof\nexplosions.\n(8)\nInsert inert gas supply hose into fuel ller opening.\n(9)\nAllow gas to ow into bay for several minutes to remove all fuel vapors. Since argon or carbon\ndioxide are heavier than air, these gasses will remain in bay during repair. Non-sparking tools\nshall be used to make repairs (air motors, plastic scrapers, etc.).\nNOTE:\nPortable vapor detectors are available to determine presence of explosive mixtures\nand are calibrated for leaded fuel. The detectors can be used to determine when it is\nsafe to make repairs.\nNOTE:\nDuring structural repair, parts must be predrilled, countersunk or dimpled, and\ncleaned before being sealed and positioned for nal installation.\n(10) Remove all existing sealant from area to be sealed, leaving a taper to the remaining sealant.\nThe taper will allow a scarf bond and a continuous seal when the new sealant is applied.\nNOTE:\nThe best method of removing sealant is with a chisel-like tool made of hard ber or\nplexiglass. Remaining sealant can be removed with aluminum wool. Steel wool or\nsandpaper must not be used.\n(11) Stop drill cracks using a No. 30 (0.128 inch) drill.\n(12) Remove all ragged edges, dents, tears, cracks, and punctures.\n(13) After removal of damaged area, leave edges parallel to any square or rectangular edge of the\nunit.\nNOTE:\nDamage adjacent to a previous repair requires removal of old repair and inclusion of\nthe entire area in the new repair.\n(14) Round all corners.\n(15) Smooth out abrasions.\n(16) Vacuum thoroughly to remove all chips, lings, dirt, etc., from bay area.\n(17) All surfaces to be sealed after repair should be thoroughly cleaned by wiping with a clean cloth\ndampened with methyl propyl ketone (MPK), acetone or similar solvent, and dried with a clean\ncloth before allowing solvent to evaporate. Always pour the solvent on the cloth to prevent\ncontaminating solvent. Do not allow cloth to drip. Never use contaminated solvent.\n(18) Any repair that breaks the fuel bay seal will require resealing that bay area, refer to applicable\nMaintenance Manual, Chapter 28, Fuel Tank Sealing - Maintenance Practices for sealing\nmaterials and procedures.\n"

Light red rust on bolt heads, hold-down nuts, and other nonstructural hardware\nis generally not dangerous. However, it is indicative of a general lack of maintenance\nand possible attack in more critical areas, such as highly stressed steel landing gear\ncomponents and ight control surface actuating components. When paint failures occur\nor mechanical damage exposes highly stressed steel surfaces to the atmosphere, even\nsmall amounts of rusting are potentially dangerous and must be removed.\nThe most\npractical means of controlling corrosion of steel is the complete removal of the corrosion\nproducts by mechanical means.\nExcept on highly stressed steel surfaces, the use of\nabrasive papers, small power buffers and bufng compounds, and wire brushes are\nacceptable for clean up procedures. However, residual rust usually remains in the bottom\nof small pits and crevices.\n1\nClean area to be reworked.\n2\nStrip paint as required.\n3\nRemove all degrees of corrosion from steel parts using a stainless steel hand brush\nor hand operated power tool.

Frequently, the force causing the initial damage is transmitted\nfrom one member to the next, causing strains and distortions. Abnormal stresses incurred by shock\nor impact forces on a rib, bulkhead, or similar structure, may be transmitted to the extremity of the\nstructural member, resulting in secondary damage, such as sheared or stretched rivets, elongated bolt\nholes, or canned skins or bulkheads. Points of attachment should be examined carefully for distortion\nand security of fastenings in the primary and secondary damaged areas at locations beyond the local\ndamage.

If\nAccelagold surface was removed by the cleaning process it must be re-applied in\naccordance with the procedure in section 6-19, \"Application Of Accelagold.\" [Accelagold is\nmanufactured by Turco\u00ae Products Inc.]\nCAUTION\u2026Alkaline cleaning solutions will cause corrosion to metals if not completely\nremoved.\nCarbon solvent should be employed only when carbon deposits are too hard or thick for\nremoval by other solvents.\nNo polishing compound, abrasive paste or powder is needed for cleaning engine parts. Do\nnot scrape parts or use wire brushes, sandpaper, abrasive cloth or abrasive wheels.\nScratches resulting from such methods allow concentrated stress at the scratch and may\ncause fatigue failure.\nBlasting techniques can be employed to remove hard carbon deposits if suitable equipment\nis available. Suitable types of grit for dry blasting are plastic pellets and processed natural\nmaterials such as wheat grains and crushed fruit pits or shells. Air pressure must be adjusted\nto the lowest setting that will produce the desired cleaning action. Small holes and machine\nfinished surfaces must be protected from the blast by seals and covers.\nWARNING\nAll cleaning material must be removed from parts and components after cleaning.\nCAUTION\u2026Do not use sand, metal grit or glass beads for any type of cleaning. If water\nmixed degreasing solutions containing caustic compounds or soap are used to clean\naluminum alloy components they must be thoroughly and completely rinsed with clear boiling\nwater or steam to prevent corrosion.\nCASTINGS: Gasket surfaces must be thoroughly cleaned with a suitable hydrocarbon\nsolvent such as acetone, naphtha, or methyl ethyl keytone (MEK) to remove dirt, oil and\ngrease. Surfaces must be clean, dry and free of all old gasket material before applying new\ngaskets.\nSMALL STEEL PARTS: Degrease steel parts by spraying or brushing with mineral spirit\nsolvent. Heavy grease or dirt deposits can be cleaned effectively by allowing the part to soak\nin this solvent for a short period of time.\nNOTE\u2026See Chapters 7 through 17 for specific individual system component and part\ncleaning instructions."

        "question": "What is the significance of the material and dimensions of the angle or \"J\" section used to repair wrinkles in the skin of an airplane, and how do these characteristics contribute to restoring the original strength of the area?",
        "answer": "CAUTION: Incorrect use of solvent cleaners during panel replacement may lead to scratching on the wing root. Only use protective materials and ensure that ambient temperature is met before proceeding.\n\n2.\nNegligible Damage\nA.\nAny smooth dents in the fuselage skin that are free from cracks, abrasions, and sharp corners, and\nwhich are not stress wrinkles and do not interfere with any internal structure or mechanism, may\nbe considered as negligible damage. In areas of low stress intensity, cracks, deep scratches, or\ndeep, sharp dents - which after trimming or stop-drilling can be enclosed by a two-inch circle - can\nbe considered negligible if the damaged area is at least one diameter of the enclosing circle away\nfrom all existing rivet lines and material edges. Stop drilling is considered a temporary repair and a\npermanent repair must be made as soon as practical.\nB.\nMild corrosion appearing upon clad aluminum surfaces does not necessarily indicate incipient failure of\nthe base metal. However, corrosion of all types must be carefully considered, and approved remedial\naction taken.\nC.\nSmall cans appear in the skin structure of all metal airplanes and should not necessarily be a cause\nfor concern. However. It is strongly recommended that wrinkles which appear to have originated from\nother sources, or which do not follow the general appearance of the remainder of the skin panels, be\nthoroughly investigated. Except in the landing gear bulkhead areas, wrinkles occurring over stringers\nwhich disappear when the rivet pattern is removed, may be considered negligible. However, the\nstringer rivet holes may not align perfectly with skin holes because of a permanent \"set\" in the stringer.\nIf this is apparent, replacement of the stringer will usually restore the original strength characteristics\nof the area.\nNOTE:\nWrinkles occurring in the skin of the main landing gear bulkhead areas must not be\nconsidered negligible. The skin panel must be opened sufciently to permit a thorough\nexamination of the lower portion of the landing gear bulkhead and its tie-in structure.\nD.\nWrinkles occurring in open areas which disappear when the rivets at the edge of the sheet are\nremoved, or a wrinkle which is hand removable, may often be repaired by a 1/2 inch x 1/2 inch x\n0.050 inch 2024-T42 extruded angle or a heavy \u201cJ\u201d section. The angle should be inserted fore and\naft across the center of the wrinkle and should extend to within 1/16 inch to 1/8 inch of the fuselage\nbulkheads comprising the end of the bay. Rivet pattern should be similar to existing manufactured\nseam at edge of sheet.\nE.\nNegligible damage to stringers, formed skin anges, bulkhead channel and like parts is similar to\nthat for the wing skin. Refer to Chapter 57, Wing Damage Classication for a denition of negligible\ndamage to these components."

        "question": "What are the specific conditions under which the use of liquid dye penetrants, magnetic particle, X-ray, and ultrasonic devices are more suitable than visual inspection for detecting corrosion, particularly in relation to the type of metal or surface being inspected?",
        "answer": "CAUTION: If tool availability is not confirmed, abort the panel replacement and conduct a full inspection of the fuselage skin. Failure to follow this step can result in misalignment.\n\n4.\nCorrosion Detection\nA.\nThe primary means of corrosion detection is visual, but in situations where visual inspection is not\nfeasible, other techniques must be used. The use of liquid dye penetrants, magnetic particle, X-ray,\nand ultrasonic devices can be used, but most of these sophisticated techniques are intended for the\ndetection of physical aws within metal objects rather than the detection of corrosion.\n(1)\nVisual Inspection.\n(a)\nA visual check of the metal surface can reveal the signs of corrosive attack, the most\nobvious of which is a corrosive deposit. Corrosion deposits of aluminum or magnesium\nare generally a white or grayish-white powder, while the color of ferrous compounds varies\nfrom red to dark reddish-brown.\n1\nThe indications of corrosive attack are small localized discoloration of the metal\nsurface. Surfaces protected by paint or plating may only exhibit indications of more\nadvanced corrosive attack by the presence of blisters or bulges in the protective lm.\nBulges in lap joints are indications of corrosive buildup which is well advanced.\n2\nIn may cases, because the inspection area is obscured by structural members,\nequipment installations, or for other reasons, it is awkward to check visually. In such\ncases, mirrors, boroscopes, or like devices must be used to inspect the obscured\nareas. Any means which allows a thorough inspection can be used. Magnifying\nglasses are valuable aids for determining whether or not all corrosion products have\nbeen removed during cleanup operations.\n(2)\nLiquid Dye Penetrant Inspection.\n(a)\nInspection for large stress-corrosion or corrosion fatigue cracks on nonporous or\nnonferrous metals may be accomplished using dye penetrant processes. The dye applied\nto a clean metallic surface will enter small openings or cracks by capillary action. After\nthe dye has an opportunity to be absorbed by any surface discontinuities, the excess dye\nis removed and a developer is applied to the surface. The developer acts like a blotter to\ndraw the dye from cracks or ssures back to the surface, giving visible indication of any\nfault that is present on the surface. The magnitude of the fault is indicated by the quantity\nof dye brought back to the surface by the developer."

        "answer": "CAUTION: Incorrect use of solvent cleaners during panel replacement may lead to scratching on the wing root. Only use protective materials and ensure that ambient temperature is met before proceeding.\n\n1.\nGeneral\nA.\nFor the purposes of this manual, damage is considered to be a deviation from the original\nconguration of a structural part that compromises its structural integrity by signicantly reducing its\nstrength, signicantly decreasing its resistance to fatigue, signicantly increasing its susceptibility to\ncorrosion, signicantly altering its utter characteristics, or adversely affecting the ight characteristics\nof the airplane. This can include - but is not limited to - scratches, dents, dings, gouges, cracks,\ndrill starts, double drilled holes, plastic deformation, reduction in cross-sectional areas, changes in\ncomponent center-of-gravity, missing or inadequate fasteners, corrosion, dissimilar metal contact,\nwork hardening, temper change due to excessive heat, and so forth.\nB.\nUse good judgment in determining the type of signicant change to at stock structural material. The\nterms, dent, crease, abrasion, gouge, nick, scratch, crack and corrosion, referred to elsewhere in the\nmanual, are dened below as a guide for this determination, particularly with respect to the external\nskin of the airplane:\n(1)\nDent - A dent is normally a damaged area which is depressed with respect to its normal contour.\nThere is no cross sectional area change in the material. Area boundaries are smooth. Its form\nis generally the result of contact with a relatively smoothly contoured object.\nNOTE:\nA dent-like form of damage to skin may be the result of the peening action of a\nsmoothly contoured object contacting it. If the inner surface of skin shows no contour\nchange, consider that such damage results in a local cross sectional area change.\n(2)\nCrease - A damaged area which is depressed or folded back upon itself in such a manner that its\nboundaries are sharp or well dened lines or ridges. Consider it to be the equivalent of a crack.\n(3)\nAbrasion - An abrasion is a damaged area of any size which results in a cross sectional area\nchange due to scufng, rubbing, scraping or other surface erosion.\nIt is usually rough and\nirregular.\n(4)\nGouge - A gouge is a damaged area of any size, which results in a cross sectional area change.\nIt is usually caused by contact with a relatively sharp object which produces a continuous, sharp\nor smooth channel-like groove in the material.\n(5)\nNick - A nick is a local gouge with sharp edges. Consider a series of nicks, in a line pattern to\nbe the equivalent of a gouge.\n(6)\nScratch - A scratch is a line of damage of any depth in the material and results in a cross sectional\narea change. It is usually caused by contact with a very sharp object.\n(7)\nCrack - A crack is a partial fracture or complete break in the material with the most signicant\ncross sectional area change. In appearance, it is usually an irregular line and is normally the\nresult of fatigue failure.\n(8)\nCorrosion - Corrosion, due to a complex electrochemical action, is a damaged area of any size\nand depth which results in a cross sectional area change. Depth of such pitting damage must\nbe determined by a cleanup operation. Damage of this type may occur on surfaces of structural\nelements. Refer to Corrosion and Corrosion Control, Section .\nC.\nUse good sense and proper visual measurement in the determination of signicant cross sectional\narea changes of both depth and length of any type (or combinations) of damage mentioned above."

        "answer": "CAUTION: Incorrect use of solvent cleaners during panel replacement may lead to scratching on the wing root. Only use protective materials and ensure that ambient temperature is met before proceeding.\n\n2.\nRepair Materials\nA.\nIn general, materials used in the airplane include 2024 and 7075 aluminum alloys. Sheet material\nrequiring little or no forming will generally be of 2024-T3 clad aluminum. Formed parts, such as ribs,\nbulkheads, etc., will be of 2024-T42 clad aluminum. Forgings are of 7075-T73. Materials used in\nrepairs should be, where possible, of the same material and heat treated to the same temper. The\nthickness should be equal to or greater than the material being repaired unless otherwise noted. If\nthe type of material cannot be readily determined and the forming required is not severe, 2024-T3\nmay be used generally, since the strength of -T3 is greater than that of -T4 or -T42 (-T4 and -T42 may\nbe used interchangeably, but they may not be substituted for -T3). When it is necessary to form a\npart with a smaller bend radius than the standard bend radius for 2024-T3 or 2024-T4, use 2024-0,\nand then heat treat to 2024-T42 after forming. In the event that the original temper was -T3, it may\nbe necessary to increase the material thickness sufciently to provide strength equivalent to that of\nthe original part. It is often practical to cut repair pieces from service parts listed in the parts catalog.\nSteel sheet material for reinforcement is 4130 steel heat treated to a minimum of 90,000 pounds per\nsquare inch.

        "answer": "WARNING: Inadequate panel replacement of the engine nacelle may compromise aircraft integrity. Always wear insulated gloves, follow approved methods, and check for discoloration before returning to service.\n\n1.\nGeneral\nA.\nAny repair that breaks the fuel bay seal will necessitate resealing that bay area. Repair parts that\nneed sealing must be installed during the sealing operations. All joints within the boundary of the\nbay, but which do not provide a direct fuel path out of the bay (such as fuel spar anges and rib\nanges), must be fay-surface-sealed and llet sealed on the fuel side. Fay surface sealing is applying\nsealant to one mating part before assembly. Enough sealant must be applied so it will squeeze out\ncompletely around joint when the parts are fastened together. The llet seal is applied after the joint\nis fay-surface-sealed and fastened. Sealer is (llet) applied to the edge of all riveted joints, joggles,\nbend reliefs, voids, rivets, or fasteners. All boundaries and any other place that could become a fuel\nleak are sealed. The fay sealant need not be cured before applying the llet sealer; however, the fay\nsealant must be free of dirt or other contaminants before applying llet seal.

Refer to appropriate Maintenance\nManual, Chapter 20, Torque Data - Maintenance Practices, for additional information covering torque\nvalues. Under torque can result in unnecessary wear of nuts and bolts as well as parts they are\nholding together. When insufcient pressures are applied, uneven loads will be transmitted throughout\nassembly, which may result in excessive wear or premature failure due to fatigue. Over torque can\nbe equally damaging because of failure of a bolt or nut from overstressing threaded areas. There are\na few simple, but very important, procedures that should be followed to assure that correct torque is\napplied:\n(1)\nCalibrate torque wrench periodically to assure accuracy, and recheck frequently.\n(2)\nBe sure that bolt and nut threads are clean and dry unless otherwise specied.\n(3)\nRun nut down to near contact with washer or bearing surface and check friction drag torque\nrequired to turn nut.\n(4)\nAdd friction drag torque to desired torque recommended. Refer to appropriate Maintenance\nManual, Chapter 20, Torque Data - Maintenance Practices to obtain complete torque calculating\nprocedures. This is referred to as nal torque which should register on indicator or setting for a\nsnap over-type wrench.\n(5)\nApply a smooth even pull when applying torque pressure. If chattering or a jerking motion occurs\nduring nal torque, back off and re-torque.\n(6)\nWhen installing a castellated nut, start alignment with cotter pin hole at minimum recommended\ntorque plus friction drag torque, and do not exceed maximum torque plus friction drag. If hole\nand nut castellation do not align, change washers or nut and try again. Exceeding maximum\nrecommended torque is not recommended unless specically allowed or recommended for that\nparticular installation."

        "answer": "CAUTION: If tool availability is not confirmed, abort the panel replacement and conduct a full inspection of the fuselage skin. Failure to follow this step can result in misalignment.\n\n4.\nCorrosion Detection\nA.\nThe primary means of corrosion detection is visual, but in situations where visual inspection is not\nfeasible, other techniques must be used. The use of liquid dye penetrants, magnetic particle, X-ray,\nand ultrasonic devices can be used, but most of these sophisticated techniques are intended for the\ndetection of physical aws within metal objects rather than the detection of corrosion.\n(1)\nVisual Inspection.\n(a)\nA visual check of the metal surface can reveal the signs of corrosive attack, the most\nobvious of which is a corrosive deposit. Corrosion deposits of aluminum or magnesium\nare generally a white or grayish-white powder, while the color of ferrous compounds varies\nfrom red to dark reddish-brown.\n1\nThe indications of corrosive attack are small localized discoloration of the metal\nsurface. Surfaces protected by paint or plating may only exhibit indications of more\nadvanced corrosive attack by the presence of blisters or bulges in the protective lm.\nBulges in lap joints are indications of corrosive buildup which is well advanced.\n2\nIn may cases, because the inspection area is obscured by structural members,\nequipment installations, or for other reasons, it is awkward to check visually. In such\ncases, mirrors, boroscopes, or like devices must be used to inspect the obscured\nareas. Any means which allows a thorough inspection can be used. Magnifying\nglasses are valuable aids for determining whether or not all corrosion products have\nbeen removed during cleanup operations.\n(2)\nLiquid Dye Penetrant Inspection.\n(a)\nInspection for large stress-corrosion or corrosion fatigue cracks on nonporous or\nnonferrous metals may be accomplished using dye penetrant processes. The dye applied\nto a clean metallic surface will enter small openings or cracks by capillary action. After\nthe dye has an opportunity to be absorbed by any surface discontinuities, the excess dye\nis removed and a developer is applied to the surface. The developer acts like a blotter to\ndraw the dye from cracks or ssures back to the surface, giving visible indication of any\nfault that is present on the surface. The magnitude of the fault is indicated by the quantity\nof dye brought back to the surface by the developer."

        "question": "What is the relationship between the homogeneity of the metallic structure and the likelihood of corrosion in metals used in airplane construction?",
        "answer": "WARNING: Inadequate panel replacement of the engine nacelle may compromise aircraft integrity. Always wear insulated gloves, follow approved methods, and check for discoloration before returning to service.\n\n1.\nGeneral\nA.\nCorrosion is a natural phenomenon which destroys metal by chemical or electrochemical action and\nconverts it to a metallic compound such as an oxide, hydroxide, or sulfate. All metals used in airplane\nconstruction are subject to corrosion. If exposed, attack may take place over an entire metal surface.\nIt may penetrate a surface at random forming deep pits or may follow grain boundaries. Corrosion may\nbe accentuated by stresses from external loads or from lack of homogeneity in the metallic structure\nor from improper heat treatment. It is promoted by contact between dissimilar metals or with materials\nwhich absorb moisture such as wool, rubber, felt, dirt, and so forth.\nNOTE:\nFor additional information on corrosion control for aircraft, refer to the FAA Advisory Circular\nNo. 43-4.\n(1)\nRefer to Figure 1 for a simplied illustration of the conditions which must exist for electrochemical\ncorrosion to occur.\n(a)\nThere must be a metal that corrodes and acts as the anode.\n(b)\nThere must be a less corrodible metal that acts as the cathode\n(c)\nThere must be a continuous liquid path between the two metals which acts as the\nelectrolyte, usually condensation and salt or other contamination.\n(d)\nThere must be a conductor to carry the ow of electrons from the cathode to the anode.\nThis conductor is usually in the form of a metal-to-metal contact (rivets, bolts, welds, etc.)\n(2)\nThe elimination of any one of the four conditions described above will stop the corrosion reaction\nprocess as shown in Figure 1.\n(3)\nOne of the best ways to eliminate one of the four described conditions is to apply an organic lm\n(such as paint, grease, plastic, etc.) to the surface of the metal affected. This will prevent the\nelectrolyte from connecting the cathode to the anode, and since current cannot ow, it prevents\ncorrosive reaction.\n(4)\nAt normal atmospheric temperatures, metals do not corrode appreciably without moisture, but\nthe moisture in the air is usually enough to start corrosive action.\n(5)\nWhen components and systems constructed of many different types of metals must perform\nunder various climatic conditions, corrosion becomes a complex problem. The presence of salts\non metal surfaces (from sea coast operation) greatly increases the electrical conductivity of any\nmoisture present and accelerates corrosion.\n(6)\nOther environmental conditions which contribute to corrosion are:\n(a)\nMoisture collecting on dirt particles.\n(b)\nMoisture collecting in crevices between lap joints, around rivets, bolt, and screws."

        "answer": "NOTE: If the engine nacelle shows any signs of cracks, do not proceed with the panel replacement until proper inspection and corrective action have been taken.\n\n9.\nSpacing Of Rivets\nA.\nThere are no specic rules which are applicable to every case or type of riveting. There are, however,\ncertain general rules which should be understood and followed. Edge distance of rivets should not\nbe less than two diameters of the rivet, measured from the edge of the sheet or plate to the center of\nthe rivet hole. Spacing between rivets, when in rows, depends upon several factors, principally the\nthickness of the sheet, the diameter of the rivets, and the manner in which the sheet will be stressed.\nThis spacing is seldom less than four diameters of the rivet, measured between the centers of the rivet\nholes. Rivets, spaced four diameters apart, are found in certain seams of semimonocoque fuselages,\nwebs or built up spars, and various plates or ttings. Where there are two rows of rivets, they are\nusually staggered. The transverse pitch or distance between rows should be slightly less than the\npitch of the rivets, with 75 percent of the rivet pitch being the usual practice. An average spacing or\npitch of rivets in the cover or skin of most structures, except at highly stressed points, will be from 6\nto 12 diameters of the rivet. The best practice in repair is to make pitch of rivets equal to those in the\noriginal structure."

        "answer": "WARNING: Inadequate panel replacement of the engine nacelle may compromise aircraft integrity. Always wear insulated gloves, follow approved methods, and check for discoloration before returning to service.\n\nNOTE\u2026Parts listed in Section 6-6, \"100% Replacement Parts,\" must be replaced and\ntherefore do not require cleaning.\nWARNING\nDuring any cleaning process always follow the cleaning material manufacturer's\ninstructions for use, and Material Safety Data Sheets for safety precautions and\ndisposal information.\nEngine components must be thoroughly cleaned so they can be properly inspected. All\nsurfaces must be protected from corrosion after cleaning by rinsing with a petroleum base\nsolvent and applying a coat of clean 50 weight aviation engine oil.\nCAUTION\u2026Cleaning methods other than the following may be destructive to engine parts\nand must not be used.\nAluminum Alloy Parts: Degrease aluminum alloy components by spraying or brushing with\nany fortified mineral spirit solvent. Heavy grease or dirt deposits can be cleaned effectively\nby allowing parts to soak in this solvent for a short period of time. Carbon deposits and gum\n(oil varnish) may be removed easily by immersing the part in a hot bath of an inhibited, mild\nalkaline cleaning solution. Immersion time should be only as long as necessary to remove\nthe deposit. Give special attention to cleaning studs, tapped holes and drilled holes. Caution\nmust be exercised when cleaning aluminum alloy parts using any alkaline cleaning solutions.\nImmediately after removing soaked parts from inhibited, mild alkaline bath or hot soapy\nwater, remove all traces of the alkaline by spraying the parts with a jet of steam, or brushing\nvigorously with a mineral spirit solvent. Cleaned parts may be dried by a jet of dry,\ncompressed air to remove all solvent liquids.\nCAUTION\u2026When using alkaline cleaning solutions, the cleaning solution manufacturer's\nusage, safety data and disposal information must be strictly followed. Alkaline etching\nsolutions must not be used.\nCAUTION\u2026All alkaline residues must be removed from crevices, recesses and holes to\nprevent the formation of a foaming emulsion in the engine lubrication oil after reassembly. If\nAccelagold surface was removed by the cleaning process it must be re-applied in\naccordance with the procedure in section 6-19, \"Application Of Accelagold.\" [Accelagold is\nmanufactured by Turco\u00ae Products Inc.]\nCAUTION\u2026Alkaline cleaning solutions will cause corrosion to metals if not completely\nremoved.\nCarbon solvent should be employed only when carbon deposits are too hard or thick for\nremoval by other solvents.\nNo polishing compound, abrasive paste or powder is needed for cleaning engine parts. Do\nnot scrape parts or use wire brushes, sandpaper, abrasive cloth or abrasive wheels.\nScratches resulting from such methods allow concentrated stress at the scratch and may\ncause fatigue failure.\nBlasting techniques can be employed to remove hard carbon deposits if suitable equipment\nis available. Suitable types of grit for dry blasting are plastic pellets and processed natural\nmaterials such as wheat grains and crushed fruit pits or shells. Air pressure must be adjusted\nto the lowest setting that will produce the desired cleaning action. Small holes and machine\nfinished surfaces must be protected from the blast by seals and covers.\nWARNING\nAll cleaning material must be removed from parts and components after cleaning.\nCAUTION\u2026Do not use sand, metal grit or glass beads for any type of cleaning. If water\nmixed degreasing solutions containing caustic compounds or soap are used to clean\naluminum alloy components they must be thoroughly and completely rinsed with clear boiling\nwater or steam to prevent corrosion.\nCASTINGS: Gasket surfaces must be thoroughly cleaned with a suitable hydrocarbon\nsolvent such as acetone, naphtha, or methyl ethyl keytone (MEK) to remove dirt, oil and\ngrease. Surfaces must be clean, dry and free of all old gasket material before applying new\ngaskets.\nSMALL STEEL PARTS: Degrease steel parts by spraying or brushing with mineral spirit\nsolvent. Heavy grease or dirt deposits can be cleaned effectively by allowing the part to soak\nin this solvent for a short period of time.\nNOTE\u2026See Chapters 7 through 17 for specific individual system component and part\ncleaning instructions."

However. It is strongly recommended that wrinkles which appear to have originated from\nother sources, or which do not follow the general appearance of the remainder of the skin panels, be\nthoroughly investigated. Except in the landing gear bulkhead areas, wrinkles occurring over stringers\nwhich disappear when the rivet pattern is removed, may be considered negligible. However, the\nstringer rivet holes may not align perfectly with skin holes because of a permanent \"set\" in the stringer.\nIf this is apparent, replacement of the stringer will usually restore the original strength characteristics\nof the area.\nNOTE:\nWrinkles occurring in the skin of the main landing gear bulkhead areas must not be\nconsidered negligible. The skin panel must be opened sufciently to permit a thorough\nexamination of the lower portion of the landing gear bulkhead and its tie-in structure.\nD.\nWrinkles occurring in open areas which disappear when the rivets at the edge of the sheet are\nremoved, or a wrinkle which is hand removable, may often be repaired by a 1/2 inch x 1/2 inch x\n0.050 inch 2024-T42 extruded angle or a heavy \u201cJ\u201d section.

        "question": "What are the specific considerations that should be taken into account when determining the compatibility between the rivet hole size and the blind rivet during the installation process, and how can this compatibility be verified?",
        "answer": "CAUTION: Before beginning any fastener removal, verify that the fuselage skin is isolated and secured. {Mistake} may result in unnecessary rework or component leakage.\n\n8.\nBlind Rivets\nA.\nGeneral.\n(1)\nBlind rivets are intended for use where access is available to only one side of the work.\n(2)\nReplacement of solid rivets with blind rivets should only be accomplished within the guidelines\nof Table 1, when the installation of a solid shank rivet is not possible. Blind rivets do not have the\nsame resistance to corrosion and fatigue as solid shank rivets, and should not be considered a\nuniversal replacement for solid shank rivets.\nB.\nRemoval of Blind Rivets.\nCAUTION: Do not drill completely through the rivet sleeve. This method of removing\na rivet will tend to enlarge the hole.\n(1)\nUse a small center drill to provide a guide for a larger drill on top of the rivet stem, and drill away\nthe tapered portion of the stem to destroy the lock.\n(2)\nPry the remainder of the locking collar out of the rivet head with a drift punch.\n(3)\nDrill nearly through the head of the rivet using a drill the same size as the rivet shank.\n(4)\nBreak off rivet head, using drift pin inserted into the drilled hole as a pry.\n(5)\nDrive out remaining rivet shank with a pin having a diameter equal to the rivet shank.\nC.\nInstallation of Blind Rivets.\n(1)\nRefer to Figure 2, for an illustration of installation procedures.\n(2)\nCheck that rivet hole size and rivet are compatible.\n(3)\nCheck that proper pulling head is installed on rivet gun.\n(4)\nAdjustment of pulling head must be made in accordance with manufacturers instructions.\n(5)\nCheck that proper operating air pressure is available to rivet gun.\nNOTE:\nBlind rivets may be installed using pneumatic or mechanical guns, whichever is\navailable.\n(6)\nCheck that holes in parts to be fastened are properly aligned.\n(7)\nIn blind clearance applications, check the minimum blind clearance (BK) dimension if the\nmanufactured head of blind rivet is protruding above the top sheet. The rivet will pull down the\nsheet as the stem is pulled if the BK dimension is met or exceeded.\n(8)\nThe minimum blind clearance is the BK dimension, and is listed in the manufacturers standard\nsheets.\nNOTE:\nWhen installing a blind rivet (pull-type rivet) in a hole where the previous blind rivet\nwas removed by drilling and punching the rivet out, inspect the drilled hole to assure\nall metal sheets are in place and not separated prior to pulling rivet.\nIt may be\nnecessary to insert a stiff wire in adjacent hole to hold metal in position while pulling\nrivet.\n(9)\nWhen placing pulling head on rivet stem, hold riveter and pulling head in line with axis of rivet\nwhile holding tool in a light and exible manner.\n(10) When tool is actuated, pulling head will pull down and seat against rivet head.\n(11) Clamping action will pull sheets together and seat rivet when tool is actuated.\n(12) When tool is actuated, action of rivet will automatically assist in bringing tool and pulling head\ninto proper alignment with rivet axis.\nNOTE:\nPressing down with force will not allow rivet and tool to align themselves with hole\nand could limit head setting of rivet, however, enough force to seat the head against\nthe skin is necessary.\n(13) Hold tool in line with rivet as accurately as possible, and allow a steady but light pressure; pull\ntrigger and let the rivet align itself.\n(14) When rivet is completely installed, release trigger and pulling head will eject pulling portion of\nstem through forward end.\n(15) Rivet must break within these limits.\nFastener\nDash number\nStem Flushness\nNAS1738 or NAS1739\nAll\n+0.010 or -0.020 inch\nCherry Max\n-4\n+0.010 or -0.015 inch\nCherry Max\n-5, -6\n+0.010 or -0.020 inch\n(16) Protruding stems usually indicate incorrect grip length or oversize holes.\nD.\nLoose or Working Blind Rivets.\n(1)\nBlind rivets which are found to be loose or show evidence of working must be replaced with\nrivets of like size and type. In some instances, it may be necessary to use the next larger size\nrivet. Loose fasteners may be indicated by the following situation:\n(a)\nThe fastened material moves relative to the fastener. Skin deection is evident.\n(b)\nTipping of the fastener head may indicate its looseness or slippage. Rivet head periphery\nrolled upward also indicates looseness.\n(c)\nA black or dark gray stain is found adjacent to or around the fastener head. Generally, it\ntakes the form of a dirt or oily streak aft of the loose rivet.\n(d)\nMark a red line across the fastener head and the adjacent material. Check the line at the\nnext inspection. Any loosening of the fastener will break the line as indicated in Figure 3."

Always verify tool availability before beginning.\n\n11.\nRivets for Plastic or Composite Parts\nA.\nUnlike rivets in metallic joints, blind rivets are often the rivet of choice for riveting non-metallic materials\nbecause they may be installed without the hammering necessary to install solid rivets. If the tail end\nof the rivet is adjacent to the non-metal side, install a washer over the shank to prevent the \"hole\nlling\" action built into blind rivets from overloading the non-metal hole. The hole in the washer should\nmatch the specied installation hole for the fastener. If the tail end of the rivet is installed through\nmetal substructure, the washer is not necessary.\nB.\nSoft (\"A\" 1100 aluminum shank rivets or \"B\" 5056 aluminum shank) rivets are also used to install non-\nmetallic parts. Original equipment soft rivets will be either red or green colored under the paint. If the\nbutt or driven end of the rivet is adjacent to the non-metallic part, it is preferable to install a washer over\nthe shank to prevent the rivet shank, which swells during driving, from overloading the non-metallic\nhole. The hole in the washer should match the specied installation hole for the fastener. If the tail\nend of the rivet is installed through metal substructure, the washer is not necessary. Take care when\ndriving rivets through non-metal to not overdrive the rivet. If the rivet is overdriven, the shank will swell\neven with the washer in place.

Carefully secure all panels, and consult section 05-20-00 of the maintenance manual for proper sealant application steps.\n\n7.\nWing Fuel Bay Spars/Rib Damage Criteria\nA.\nNegligible damage: Any smooth dents in the wing fuel spar and ribs that have no evidence of tears,\ncracks or penetrations - which are not stress wrinkles and do not change (Oil can, or pop in and out)\nwith internal pressure - are considered negligible damage.\nB.\nRepairable damage: Dents or bends in the wing fuel spar and ribs may be repaired by reforming\nor by replacing a section of the structure. Since aluminum work hardens, it is much more likely to\ncrack when reformed and should be carefully inspected for such cracks after rework. Removal and\nreplacement of a damaged section is preferred to reformation.\nC.\nDamage Necessitating Replacement Of Parts: Due to the amount of fuel bay sealant which must be\nremoved from fuel bay components to facilitate repair, individual parts are not available to replace fuel\nbay spars or ribs. The entire fuel bay area must be replaced as a unit."

If the tail end of the rivet is installed through\nmetal substructure, the washer is not necessary.\nB.\nSoft (\"A\" 1100 aluminum shank rivets or \"B\" 5056 aluminum shank) rivets are also used to install non-\nmetallic parts. Original equipment soft rivets will be either red or green colored under the paint. If the\nbutt or driven end of the rivet is adjacent to the non-metallic part, it is preferable to install a washer over\nthe shank to prevent the rivet shank, which swells during driving, from overloading the non-metallic\nhole.

        "answer": "WARNING: Inadequate panel replacement of the engine nacelle may compromise aircraft integrity. Always wear insulated gloves, follow approved methods, and check for discoloration before returning to service.\n\n1.\nGeneral\nA.\nCorrosion is a natural phenomenon which destroys metal by chemical or electrochemical action and\nconverts it to a metallic compound such as an oxide, hydroxide, or sulfate. All metals used in airplane\nconstruction are subject to corrosion. If exposed, attack may take place over an entire metal surface.\nIt may penetrate a surface at random forming deep pits or may follow grain boundaries. Corrosion may\nbe accentuated by stresses from external loads or from lack of homogeneity in the metallic structure\nor from improper heat treatment. It is promoted by contact between dissimilar metals or with materials\nwhich absorb moisture such as wool, rubber, felt, dirt, and so forth.\nNOTE:\nFor additional information on corrosion control for aircraft, refer to the FAA Advisory Circular\nNo. 43-4.\n(1)\nRefer to Figure 1 for a simplied illustration of the conditions which must exist for electrochemical\ncorrosion to occur.\n(a)\nThere must be a metal that corrodes and acts as the anode.\n(b)\nThere must be a less corrodible metal that acts as the cathode\n(c)\nThere must be a continuous liquid path between the two metals which acts as the\nelectrolyte, usually condensation and salt or other contamination.\n(d)\nThere must be a conductor to carry the ow of electrons from the cathode to the anode.\nThis conductor is usually in the form of a metal-to-metal contact (rivets, bolts, welds, etc.)\n(2)\nThe elimination of any one of the four conditions described above will stop the corrosion reaction\nprocess as shown in Figure 1.\n(3)\nOne of the best ways to eliminate one of the four described conditions is to apply an organic lm\n(such as paint, grease, plastic, etc.) to the surface of the metal affected. This will prevent the\nelectrolyte from connecting the cathode to the anode, and since current cannot ow, it prevents\ncorrosive reaction.\n(4)\nAt normal atmospheric temperatures, metals do not corrode appreciably without moisture, but\nthe moisture in the air is usually enough to start corrosive action.\n(5)\nWhen components and systems constructed of many different types of metals must perform\nunder various climatic conditions, corrosion becomes a complex problem. The presence of salts\non metal surfaces (from sea coast operation) greatly increases the electrical conductivity of any\nmoisture present and accelerates corrosion.\n(6)\nOther environmental conditions which contribute to corrosion are:\n(a)\nMoisture collecting on dirt particles.\n(b)\nMoisture collecting in crevices between lap joints, around rivets, bolt, and screws."

        "answer": "WARNING: Inadequate panel replacement of the engine nacelle may compromise aircraft integrity. Always wear insulated gloves, follow approved methods, and check for discoloration before returning to service.\n\nHelical coil inserts are installed at the factory in various tapped holes of some engine\ncomponents. Stainless steel helical coil inserts of special design are installed in all spark\nplug holes. Any of these inserts may be replaced if damaged. Tools, inserts and information\nare available through HeliCoil\u00ae, Emhart Fastening Teknologies. Contact HeliCoil\u00ae\nApplications Engineering or customer service at: (203) 924-4737 for local distributor\ninformation. The manufacturer's Bulletins 959A, 995, 943, T4000 and 1000 latest revisions\nlist manual and power-driven installing tools, tang break-off tools, special taps, plug gauges\nand tap/drill information. Helical coil inserts are available in both National Course and\nNational Fine series in lengths equal to 1, 1 -1 /2 and 2 times nominal diameter and in pipe\nthread sizes. They are made of either carbon steel, phosphor bronze or stainless steel, as\nspecified by part number. They are supplied with or without a notch above the driving tang.\nThe notch is provided to facilitate breaking off the tang in open holes.\nHelical coil inserts are helical coils of wire with a diamond-shaped cross section forming both\na male and female thread. When compressed into a special tapped hole at the widest part of\nthe wire, between male and female threads, the diameter of the insert is equal to the nominal\nscrew size. The special finishing taps size the casting hole so the pitch diameter of the\nfemale thread of the installed insert conforms to Class 3 fit with standard bolt threads or class\n4 (tight) fit with standard-size studs. The difference in fit is due to a difference in pitch\ndiameters of bolts and studs. Only one set of helical coil special taps is required for\ninstallation of these inserts in both bolt holes and stud holes. Tap drilling depths and tapping\ndepth for helical coil inserts to be installed in blind holes should conform to the\nrecommendations relative to inserts of length equal to 2 times nominal diameter, as tabulated\nin the manufacturer's Bulletin Numbers 1000 and T4000 latest revision. Helical coil tap drills\nand special taps must be run in perpendicular to the machined surface of the casting. Drilling\nmust be done in a drill press after the casting is firmly supported, clamped and alignment\nchecked. The tap will tend to follow the drilled hole. For drilling and tapping aluminum alloy\ncastings use a commercial grade cutting lubrication oil to prevent overheating of the metal\nand tearing of the thread."

        "question": "What is the relationship between the type of metal that corrodes and acts as the anode and the likelihood of electrochemical corrosion occurring in airplane construction materials?",
        "answer": "WARNING: Inadequate panel replacement of the engine nacelle may compromise aircraft integrity. Always wear insulated gloves, follow approved methods, and check for discoloration before returning to service.\n\n1.\nGeneral\nA.\nCorrosion is a natural phenomenon which destroys metal by chemical or electrochemical action and\nconverts it to a metallic compound such as an oxide, hydroxide, or sulfate. All metals used in airplane\nconstruction are subject to corrosion. If exposed, attack may take place over an entire metal surface.\nIt may penetrate a surface at random forming deep pits or may follow grain boundaries. Corrosion may\nbe accentuated by stresses from external loads or from lack of homogeneity in the metallic structure\nor from improper heat treatment. It is promoted by contact between dissimilar metals or with materials\nwhich absorb moisture such as wool, rubber, felt, dirt, and so forth.\nNOTE:\nFor additional information on corrosion control for aircraft, refer to the FAA Advisory Circular\nNo. 43-4.\n(1)\nRefer to Figure 1 for a simplied illustration of the conditions which must exist for electrochemical\ncorrosion to occur.\n(a)\nThere must be a metal that corrodes and acts as the anode.\n(b)\nThere must be a less corrodible metal that acts as the cathode\n(c)\nThere must be a continuous liquid path between the two metals which acts as the\nelectrolyte, usually condensation and salt or other contamination.\n(d)\nThere must be a conductor to carry the ow of electrons from the cathode to the anode.\nThis conductor is usually in the form of a metal-to-metal contact (rivets, bolts, welds, etc.)\n(2)\nThe elimination of any one of the four conditions described above will stop the corrosion reaction\nprocess as shown in Figure 1.\n(3)\nOne of the best ways to eliminate one of the four described conditions is to apply an organic lm\n(such as paint, grease, plastic, etc.) to the surface of the metal affected. This will prevent the\nelectrolyte from connecting the cathode to the anode, and since current cannot ow, it prevents\ncorrosive reaction.\n(4)\nAt normal atmospheric temperatures, metals do not corrode appreciably without moisture, but\nthe moisture in the air is usually enough to start corrosive action.\n(5)\nWhen components and systems constructed of many different types of metals must perform\nunder various climatic conditions, corrosion becomes a complex problem. The presence of salts\non metal surfaces (from sea coast operation) greatly increases the electrical conductivity of any\nmoisture present and accelerates corrosion.\n(6)\nOther environmental conditions which contribute to corrosion are:\n(a)\nMoisture collecting on dirt particles.\n(b)\nMoisture collecting in crevices between lap joints, around rivets, bolt, and screws."

        "answer": "WARNING: solvent cleaners must never be used near fuselage skin due to risk of toxic exposure. Before beginning the sealant application, ensure that the area is free of coolant vapor and personnel are wearing inspection mirror.\n\n3.\nTypical Corrosion Areas\nA.\nThis section lists typical areas of the airplane which are susceptible to corrosion. These areas should\nbe carefully inspected at periodic intervals to detect corrosion as early as possible.\n(1)\nEngine Exhaust Trail Areas.\n(a)\nGaps, seams, and fairings on the lower fuselage, aft of the engine exhaust pipe(s) are\ntypical areas where deposits may be trapped and not reached by normal cleaning methods.\n(b)\nAround rivet heads, skin laps and inspection covers on the airplane lower fuselage aft of\nthe engine exhaust pipe(s) should be carefully cleaned and inspected.\n(2)\nBattery Box and Battery Vent Opening.\n(a)\nThe battery, battery cover, battery box, and adjacent areas, especially areas below the\nbattery box where battery electrolyte may have seeped, are particularly subject to corrosive\naction. If spilled battery electrolyte is neutralized and cleaned up at the same time of\nspillage, corrosion can be held to a minimum by using a baking soda solution to neutralize\nthe lead acid-type battery electrolyte. If baking soda is not available, ood the area with\nwater.\n(3)\nStainless Steel control cables.\n(a)\nChecking for corrosion on control cables is normally accomplished during the preventative\nmaintenance check. During preventative maintenance, broken wire and wear of the control\ncable is also checked.\n(b)\nIf the surface of the cable is corroded, carefully force the cable open by reverse twisting\nand visually inspect the interior. Corrosion on the interior strands of the cable constitutes\nfailure and the cable must be replaced. If no internal corrosion is detected, remove loose\nexternal rust and corrosion with a clean, dry, coarse-weave rag or ber brush.\nNOTE:\nDo not use metallic wools or solvents to clean installed cables. Use of metallic\nwool will embed dissimilar metal particles in the cables and create further\ncorrosion. Solvents will remove internal cable lubricant, allowing cable strands\nto abrade and further corrode.\n(c)\nAfter thorough cleaning of the exterior cable surface, apply a light coat of lubricant (VV-L-\n800) to the external cable surface."

There are, however,\ncertain general rules which should be understood and followed. Edge distance of rivets should not\nbe less than two diameters of the rivet, measured from the edge of the sheet or plate to the center of\nthe rivet hole. Spacing between rivets, when in rows, depends upon several factors, principally the\nthickness of the sheet, the diameter of the rivets, and the manner in which the sheet will be stressed.\nThis spacing is seldom less than four diameters of the rivet, measured between the centers of the rivet\nholes. Rivets, spaced four diameters apart, are found in certain seams of semimonocoque fuselages,\nwebs or built up spars, and various plates or ttings. Where there are two rows of rivets, they are\nusually staggered. The transverse pitch or distance between rows should be slightly less than the\npitch of the rivets, with 75 percent of the rivet pitch being the usual practice. An average spacing or\npitch of rivets in the cover or skin of most structures, except at highly stressed points, will be from 6\nto 12 diameters of the rivet.

        "answer": "WARNING: Inadequate panel replacement of the engine nacelle may compromise aircraft integrity. Always wear insulated gloves, follow approved methods, and check for discoloration before returning to service.\n\n1.\nGeneral\nA.\nCorrosion is a natural phenomenon which destroys metal by chemical or electrochemical action and\nconverts it to a metallic compound such as an oxide, hydroxide, or sulfate. All metals used in airplane\nconstruction are subject to corrosion. If exposed, attack may take place over an entire metal surface.\nIt may penetrate a surface at random forming deep pits or may follow grain boundaries. Corrosion may\nbe accentuated by stresses from external loads or from lack of homogeneity in the metallic structure\nor from improper heat treatment. It is promoted by contact between dissimilar metals or with materials\nwhich absorb moisture such as wool, rubber, felt, dirt, and so forth.\nNOTE:\nFor additional information on corrosion control for aircraft, refer to the FAA Advisory Circular\nNo. 43-4.\n(1)\nRefer to Figure 1 for a simplied illustration of the conditions which must exist for electrochemical\ncorrosion to occur.\n(a)\nThere must be a metal that corrodes and acts as the anode.\n(b)\nThere must be a less corrodible metal that acts as the cathode\n(c)\nThere must be a continuous liquid path between the two metals which acts as the\nelectrolyte, usually condensation and salt or other contamination.\n(d)\nThere must be a conductor to carry the ow of electrons from the cathode to the anode.\nThis conductor is usually in the form of a metal-to-metal contact (rivets, bolts, welds, etc.)\n(2)\nThe elimination of any one of the four conditions described above will stop the corrosion reaction\nprocess as shown in Figure 1.\n(3)\nOne of the best ways to eliminate one of the four described conditions is to apply an organic lm\n(such as paint, grease, plastic, etc.) to the surface of the metal affected. This will prevent the\nelectrolyte from connecting the cathode to the anode, and since current cannot ow, it prevents\ncorrosive reaction.\n(4)\nAt normal atmospheric temperatures, metals do not corrode appreciably without moisture, but\nthe moisture in the air is usually enough to start corrosive action.\n(5)\nWhen components and systems constructed of many different types of metals must perform\nunder various climatic conditions, corrosion becomes a complex problem. The presence of salts\non metal surfaces (from sea coast operation) greatly increases the electrical conductivity of any\nmoisture present and accelerates corrosion.\n(6)\nOther environmental conditions which contribute to corrosion are:\n(a)\nMoisture collecting on dirt particles.\n(b)\nMoisture collecting in crevices between lap joints, around rivets, bolt, and screws."

        "question": "What are the implications of not addressing mild corrosion on clad aluminum surfaces of an airplane, and how does it relate to the potential failure of the base metal over time?",
        "answer": "CAUTION: Incorrect use of solvent cleaners during panel replacement may lead to scratching on the wing root. Only use protective materials and ensure that ambient temperature is met before proceeding.\n\n2.\nNegligible Damage\nA.\nAny smooth dents in the fuselage skin that are free from cracks, abrasions, and sharp corners, and\nwhich are not stress wrinkles and do not interfere with any internal structure or mechanism, may\nbe considered as negligible damage. In areas of low stress intensity, cracks, deep scratches, or\ndeep, sharp dents - which after trimming or stop-drilling can be enclosed by a two-inch circle - can\nbe considered negligible if the damaged area is at least one diameter of the enclosing circle away\nfrom all existing rivet lines and material edges. Stop drilling is considered a temporary repair and a\npermanent repair must be made as soon as practical.\nB.\nMild corrosion appearing upon clad aluminum surfaces does not necessarily indicate incipient failure of\nthe base metal. However, corrosion of all types must be carefully considered, and approved remedial\naction taken.\nC.\nSmall cans appear in the skin structure of all metal airplanes and should not necessarily be a cause\nfor concern. However. It is strongly recommended that wrinkles which appear to have originated from\nother sources, or which do not follow the general appearance of the remainder of the skin panels, be\nthoroughly investigated. Except in the landing gear bulkhead areas, wrinkles occurring over stringers\nwhich disappear when the rivet pattern is removed, may be considered negligible. However, the\nstringer rivet holes may not align perfectly with skin holes because of a permanent \"set\" in the stringer.\nIf this is apparent, replacement of the stringer will usually restore the original strength characteristics\nof the area.\nNOTE:\nWrinkles occurring in the skin of the main landing gear bulkhead areas must not be\nconsidered negligible. The skin panel must be opened sufciently to permit a thorough\nexamination of the lower portion of the landing gear bulkhead and its tie-in structure.\nD.\nWrinkles occurring in open areas which disappear when the rivets at the edge of the sheet are\nremoved, or a wrinkle which is hand removable, may often be repaired by a 1/2 inch x 1/2 inch x\n0.050 inch 2024-T42 extruded angle or a heavy \u201cJ\u201d section. The angle should be inserted fore and\naft across the center of the wrinkle and should extend to within 1/16 inch to 1/8 inch of the fuselage\nbulkheads comprising the end of the bay. Rivet pattern should be similar to existing manufactured\nseam at edge of sheet.\nE.\nNegligible damage to stringers, formed skin anges, bulkhead channel and like parts is similar to\nthat for the wing skin. Refer to Chapter 57, Wing Damage Classication for a denition of negligible\ndamage to these components."

Repair parts that\nneed sealing must be installed during the sealing operations. All joints within the boundary of the\nbay, but which do not provide a direct fuel path out of the bay (such as fuel spar anges and rib\nanges), must be fay-surface-sealed and llet sealed on the fuel side. Fay surface sealing is applying\nsealant to one mating part before assembly. Enough sealant must be applied so it will squeeze out\ncompletely around joint when the parts are fastened together. The llet seal is applied after the joint\nis fay-surface-sealed and fastened. Sealer is (llet) applied to the edge of all riveted joints, joggles,\nbend reliefs, voids, rivets, or fasteners. All boundaries and any other place that could become a fuel\nleak are sealed. The fay sealant need not be cured before applying the llet sealer; however, the fay\nsealant must be free of dirt or other contaminants before applying llet seal. Fillets laid on intersecting\njoints shall be joined together to produce a continuous seal. Sealant must be pressed into the joint to\ndisplace any entrapped air bubbles.

Carefully evacuate personnel, and consult section 05-20-00 of the maintenance manual for proper panel replacement steps.\n\n7.\nControl of Corrosion on Landing Gear Springs\nA.\nGeneral\n(1)\nThe main landing gear springs are made from high strength steel that is shot peened on the\nlower surface to increase the fatigue life of the part.\n(2)\nThe shot peened layer is between 0.010 and 0.020 inch thick.\n(3)\nIf the protective layer of paint is chipped, scratched or worn away the steel may corrode (rust).\n(a)\nIf the corrosion pit depth is greater than the thickness of the shot peen layer, the gear spring\nfatigue life will be greatly reduced.\n(4)\nOperation from unimproved surfaces increases the likelihood of damage.\nB.\nCorrosion removal and repair.\n(1)\nIf damage to the paint nish of the landing gear spring is found, examine the damage area for\nsigns of corrosion (red rust).\nWARNING: High strength steel parts are very susceptible to hydrogen\nembrittlement.\nAcidic solutions, such as rust removers\nand paint strippers have been found to cause hydrogen\nembrittlement.\nHydrogen embrittlement is an undetectable,\ntime delayed process.\nSince the process is time delayed,\nfailure may occur after the part is returned to service.\nThe\nonly reliable way to prevent hydrogen embrittlement is not to\nuse chemical rust removers or paint strippers on landing gear\nsprings.\n(2)\nCarefully remove any rust by light sanding.\n(a)\nThe sanding should blend the damage into the surrounding area in an approximate 20:1\nratio.\nEXAMPLE:\nAn 0.005 inch pit must be blended to a 0.10 inch radius or 0.20 inch\ndiameter.\n(b)\nMake sure the nal sanding marks are along an inboard to outboard direction, or along the\nlong dimension of the spring.\n(3)\nAfter the sanding is complete, measure the depth of the damage removal.\n(a)\nMake sure the depth of the damage is not more than 0.010 to 0.012 inch deep and has not\npenetrated the shot peen layer.\n(4)\nIf the shot peened layer has been penetrated, the gear spring must be removed and sent to an\napproved facility to be re-shotpeened.\n(a)\nThe shotpeen specication is to be Almen intensity of 0.012 to 0.016 using 330 steel shot.\n(5)\nAfter the spring is installed, renish any damaged or removed nish paint.\nNOTE:\nAdditional information regarding corrosion control can be found in AC-43-4, Chapter\n6, or AC43.13-1B Chapter 6.\nC.\nAxle bolt hole corrosion.\n(1)\nOperation of an airplane on skis increases the loads on the lower part of the gear spring because\nof the unsymmetrical and twisting loads.\n(a)\nThe increased loads have produced spring fractures that originate from pits in the axle\nattach holes.\n1\nCatastrophic failures have occurred from fatigue cracks as small as 0.003 to 0.010\ninch long that originated at pits.\n(b)\nAlthough operation on skis causes more loads, the criteria applies to all airplanes.\n(2)\nThere is no acceptable damage depth for pits that develop in the axle bolt holes. If pits or\ncorrosion is found it must be removed by reaming, subject to the following limitations:\n(a)\nRemove the minimum material required to clean up the damage.\n(b)\nMake sure the diameter of the axle attachment holes is 0.383 inches maximum for 3/8 inch\nbolts.\n(c)\nMake sure the diameter of the axle attachment holes is 0.321 inches maximum for 5/16\ninch bolts.\n(d)\nIf reaming to the maximum dimension does not remove all signs of corrosion, discard the\nlanding gear spring.\n"

Use defueling nozzle to remove fuel from container.\n(7)\nIf necessary, repeat procedures for opposite wing.\nWARNING: Purge fuel bays with an inert gas (argon or carbon dioxide)\nprior\nto\nrepairing\nfuel\nleaks\nto\npreclude\npossibility\nof\nexplosions.\n(8)\nInsert inert gas supply hose into fuel ller opening.\n(9)\nAllow gas to ow into bay for several minutes to remove all fuel vapors. Since argon or carbon\ndioxide are heavier than air, these gasses will remain in bay during repair. Non-sparking tools\nshall be used to make repairs (air motors, plastic scrapers, etc.).\nNOTE:\nPortable vapor detectors are available to determine presence of explosive mixtures\nand are calibrated for leaded fuel. The detectors can be used to determine when it is\nsafe to make repairs.\nNOTE:\nDuring structural repair, parts must be predrilled, countersunk or dimpled, and\ncleaned before being sealed and positioned for nal installation.\n(10) Remove all existing sealant from area to be sealed, leaving a taper to the remaining sealant.\nThe taper will allow a scarf bond and a continuous seal when the new sealant is applied.\nNOTE:\nThe best method of removing sealant is with a chisel-like tool made of hard ber or\nplexiglass. Remaining sealant can be removed with aluminum wool. Steel wool or\nsandpaper must not be used.\n(11) Stop drill cracks using a No. 30 (0.128 inch) drill.\n(12) Remove all ragged edges, dents, tears, cracks, and punctures.\n(13) After removal of damaged area, leave edges parallel to any square or rectangular edge of the\nunit.\nNOTE:\nDamage adjacent to a previous repair requires removal of old repair and inclusion of\nthe entire area in the new repair.\n(14) Round all corners.\n(15) Smooth out abrasions.\n(16) Vacuum thoroughly to remove all chips, lings, dirt, etc., from bay area.\n(17) All surfaces to be sealed after repair should be thoroughly cleaned by wiping with a clean cloth\ndampened with methyl propyl ketone (MPK), acetone or similar solvent, and dried with a clean\ncloth before allowing solvent to evaporate. Always pour the solvent on the cloth to prevent\ncontaminating solvent. Do not allow cloth to drip. Never use contaminated solvent.\n(18) Any repair that breaks the fuel bay seal will require resealing that bay area, refer to applicable\nMaintenance Manual, Chapter 28, Fuel Tank Sealing - Maintenance Practices for sealing\nmaterials and procedures.\n"

        "question": "What considerations should be taken into account when deciding whether to use a blind rivet or a soft rivet for installing non-metallic parts, considering the potential for the rivet to overload the non-metallic hole during installation?",
        "answer": "NOTE: This procedure applies specifically to aircraft models with engine nacelle configurations post-2015. For older models, refer to AMM revision 22B or later. Always verify tool availability before beginning.\n\n11.\nRivets for Plastic or Composite Parts\nA.\nUnlike rivets in metallic joints, blind rivets are often the rivet of choice for riveting non-metallic materials\nbecause they may be installed without the hammering necessary to install solid rivets. If the tail end\nof the rivet is adjacent to the non-metal side, install a washer over the shank to prevent the \"hole\nlling\" action built into blind rivets from overloading the non-metal hole. The hole in the washer should\nmatch the specied installation hole for the fastener. If the tail end of the rivet is installed through\nmetal substructure, the washer is not necessary.\nB.\nSoft (\"A\" 1100 aluminum shank rivets or \"B\" 5056 aluminum shank) rivets are also used to install non-\nmetallic parts. Original equipment soft rivets will be either red or green colored under the paint. If the\nbutt or driven end of the rivet is adjacent to the non-metallic part, it is preferable to install a washer over\nthe shank to prevent the rivet shank, which swells during driving, from overloading the non-metallic\nhole. The hole in the washer should match the specied installation hole for the fastener. If the tail\nend of the rivet is installed through metal substructure, the washer is not necessary. Take care when\ndriving rivets through non-metal to not overdrive the rivet. If the rivet is overdriven, the shank will swell\neven with the washer in place. The rivet butt should be driven to no more than necessary to retain\nthe part, never more than 1.4 times the shank diameter.\nC.\nIf the original equipment rivet provided connection between metal parts as well as non-metallic parts,\nit may be a standard (AD) rivet. Original equipment AD rivets are colored gold or uncolored. Replace\noriginal equipment AD rivets with AD rivets.\n"

        "question": "What are the specific requirements and guidelines for backing up the rivet on the shop head when center punching to avoid depressing the metal, particularly in the case of thin metal?",
        "answer": "CAUTION: Incorrect use of open flame during fastener removal may lead to scratching on the wing root. Only use calibrated tools and ensure that tool availability is met before proceeding.\n\n7.\nSolid Shank Rivets\nA.\nRemoval of Solid Shank Rivets (Refer to Figure 1).\n(1)\nWhen it becomes necessary to replace a rivet, extreme care should be taken in its removal so\nthat the rivet hole will retain its original size and replacement with a larger size rivet will not be\nnecessary. If the rivet is not removed properly, the strength of the joint may be weakened and\nthe replacement of rivets made more difcult.\n(2)\nWhen removing a rivet, work on the manufactured head. It is more symmetrical about the shank\nthan the shop head, and there will be less chance of damaging the rivet hole or the material\naround it. To remove rivets, use hand tools, a power drill or a combination of both. The preferred\nmethod is to drill through the rivet head and drive out the remainder of the rivet with a drift punch.\nFirst, le a at area on the head of any round or brazier head rivet, and center punch the at\nsurface for drilling. On thin metal, back up the rivet on the shop head when center punching\nto avoid depressing the metal. The dimple in 2117-T3 rivets usually eliminates the necessity of\nling and center punching the rivet.\n(3)\nSelect a drill one size smaller than the rivet shank and drill out the rivet head. When using a\npower drill, set the drill on the rivet and rotate the chuck several revolutions by hand before\nturning on the power. This procedure helps the drill cut a good starting spot and eliminates the\nchance of the drill slipping off and tracking across the metal. While holding the drill at a 90\u00b0\nangle, drill the rivet to the depth of its head. Be careful not to drill too deep because the rivet\nshank will turn with the drill and cause a tear. The rivet head will often break away and climb the\ndrill, which is a good signal to withdraw the drill. If the rivet head does not come lose of its own\naccord, insert a drift punch into the hole and twist slightly to either side until the head comes off.\n(4)\nDrive out the shank of the rivet with a drift punch slightly smaller than the diameter of the shank.\nOn thin metal or unsupported structures, support the sheet with a bucking bar while driving out\nthe shank. If the shank is exceptionally tight after the rivet head is removed, drill the rivet about\ntwo-thirds of the way through the thickness of the material and then drive out the remainder of\nthe rivet with a drift punch.\n(5)\nThe removal of ush rivets is the same as that just described except that no ling of the\nmanufactured head is required before center punching. Be very careful to avoid elongation\nof the dimpled or the countersunk holes. The rivet head should be drilled to approximately\none-half the thickness of the top sheet.\nTable 1.

NAS1738M4-4\nrivets may be identied as AIA/NAS1738M4-4.\nC.\nInstallation of Solid Shank Rivets.\n(1)\nA large percentage of riveting of airplane structure is accomplished on thin gauge aluminum alloy,\nand the work must be accomplished without distorting or damaging the material with hammer\nblows or riveting tools. All airplane power riveting is accomplished by upsetting the rivets against\na bucking bar instead of striking the shank with a hammer. To prevent deforming the rivet head,\na rivet set must be selected to t each type of rivet. The depth of this set must not touch material\nbeing riveted. Parts requiring heat treatment should be heat treated before riveting, since heat\ntreating process after rivet installation causes warping. Assemblies that require heat treatment\nin a salt bath must be treated prior to assembly, as the salt cannot be entirely washed out of the\njoints.\n(2)\nThe use of hollow rivets in joining highly stressed parts is not permitted. To determine if blind\nrivets may be substituted, refer to Tables 1 and 2. Selection of the proper rivet and the proper\nnumber of rivets is very important. Rivets must be of the proper length for the total thickness of\nthe parts being riveted. Ordinarily, from 1-1/2 to 2 times the diameter of the rivet is the correct\namount for the rivet shank to protrude through the material to form the head. For heavy material,\nsuch as plates or ttings, from 2 to 2-1/2 times the rivet diameter may be used. The rivet should\nnot be excessively loose in the hole, as this condition will cause the rivet to bend over while\nbeing driven, and the shank will not be sufciently expanded to completely ll the hole. A drill\nfrom 0.002 inch to 0.004 inch larger than the rivet shank should be used for sheet and plate\nriveting. Parts should be held rmly together by clamps, screws, or bolts while they are being\ndrilled or riveted. The bucking bar is to be held against the end of the rivet shank. Exercise care\nwhile accomplishing this operation to prevent unseating the rivet by too much pressure. For the\nrst few blows, the bucking bar should be held lightly against the rivet shank so it will receive\nthe impact of the blow through the rivet. The bucking bar must be held square with the rivet\nto produce uniform upsets. As few blows as possible should be struck to properly upset rivet.\nBlows must be as uniform as possible.\nD.\nLoose Or Working Solid Shank Rivets.\n(1)\nRivets which appear to be loose shall be checked with a 0.002 inch feeler gauge by inserting the\ngauge around the head of the rivet in question. If the feeler gauge can be inserted to the shank\nof the rivet, it shall be classied as a loose rivet and it shall be replaced. If the feeler gauge can\nbe inserted approximately halfway to the shank for less than 30 percent of the circumference\nof the rivet head, it shall not be classied as a loose rivet. The feeler gauge shall be used to\ncheck the shear section between the riveted members (such as skin to spar or different sections\nof skins) in a similar manner to that used around the rivet head. If the skin around the brazier\nhead or countersunk rivet can be moved by depressing the skin with nger pressure around the\nrivet, the rivet shall be replaced. If a rivet is found which turns by applying a rotating load to the\nhead of the rivet, it should be replaced.\n(2)\nIn areas where exterior paint has been applied to rivet heads, the paint may harden due to aging\nprocesses and show hairline cracks around the edge of the rivet heads. This should not be\nused as a basis for determining whether or not the rivet is loose. The hardened paint may crack\nat times and collect dirt or exhaust fumes which will appear as discoloration. It is not possible\nto detect loose rivets visually. Replacement rivets should be of like size and type. In some\ninstances, however, it will be necessary to use the next size larger diameter. For general repair\npractices, the spacing between the centerlines of adjacent rivet holes shall be four diameters or\ngreater. In some areas where the spacing between rivets prohibits the use of the next larger\nrivets, special repair instructions and procedures shall be followed.\nContact Cessna Single\nEngine Support."

The accelerator can then be poured into the container of sealant for mixing; otherwise, a\nwax-free container must be used. Stir accelerator and sealant until they become a uniform mixture.\nDo not stir air into mixture so it forms bubbles; if bubbles appear, they must be removed.\nCAUTION: Protect drain holes and fuel outlet screens when applying sealants.\nNOTE:\nWork life of sealants contained in SK210-56 is 2 hours from the start of mixing. Work life\nof sealants contained in SK210-101 is one-half hour from the start of mixing. This is based\non a standard condition of 77\u00b0F (25\u00b0C) and 50 percent relative humidi ty. An increase in\neither temperature or humidity will shorten the work life of the sealants."

        "answer": "CAUTION: If tool availability is not confirmed, abort the panel replacement and conduct a full inspection of the fuselage skin. Failure to follow this step can result in misalignment.\n\n4.\nCorrosion Detection\nA.\nThe primary means of corrosion detection is visual, but in situations where visual inspection is not\nfeasible, other techniques must be used. The use of liquid dye penetrants, magnetic particle, X-ray,\nand ultrasonic devices can be used, but most of these sophisticated techniques are intended for the\ndetection of physical aws within metal objects rather than the detection of corrosion.\n(1)\nVisual Inspection.\n(a)\nA visual check of the metal surface can reveal the signs of corrosive attack, the most\nobvious of which is a corrosive deposit. Corrosion deposits of aluminum or magnesium\nare generally a white or grayish-white powder, while the color of ferrous compounds varies\nfrom red to dark reddish-brown.\n1\nThe indications of corrosive attack are small localized discoloration of the metal\nsurface. Surfaces protected by paint or plating may only exhibit indications of more\nadvanced corrosive attack by the presence of blisters or bulges in the protective lm.\nBulges in lap joints are indications of corrosive buildup which is well advanced.\n2\nIn may cases, because the inspection area is obscured by structural members,\nequipment installations, or for other reasons, it is awkward to check visually. In such\ncases, mirrors, boroscopes, or like devices must be used to inspect the obscured\nareas. Any means which allows a thorough inspection can be used. Magnifying\nglasses are valuable aids for determining whether or not all corrosion products have\nbeen removed during cleanup operations.\n(2)\nLiquid Dye Penetrant Inspection.\n(a)\nInspection for large stress-corrosion or corrosion fatigue cracks on nonporous or\nnonferrous metals may be accomplished using dye penetrant processes. The dye applied\nto a clean metallic surface will enter small openings or cracks by capillary action. After\nthe dye has an opportunity to be absorbed by any surface discontinuities, the excess dye\nis removed and a developer is applied to the surface. The developer acts like a blotter to\ndraw the dye from cracks or ssures back to the surface, giving visible indication of any\nfault that is present on the surface. The magnitude of the fault is indicated by the quantity\nof dye brought back to the surface by the developer."

Take care when\ndriving rivets through non-metal to not overdrive the rivet. If the rivet is overdriven, the shank will swell\neven with the washer in place. The rivet butt should be driven to no more than necessary to retain\nthe part, never more than 1.4 times the shank diameter.\nC.\nIf the original equipment rivet provided connection between metal parts as well as non-metallic parts,\nit may be a standard (AD) rivet. Original equipment AD rivets are colored gold or uncolored. Replace\noriginal equipment AD rivets with AD rivets.\n"

Always verify aircraft model before beginning.\n\n2.\nWing Skin Damage Criteria\nA.\nNegligible damage: Any smooth dents in the wing skin that are not more than 0.030 inch below\ncontour and can be circumscribed with a 2 inch diameter circle that have no evidence of skin tears,\ncracks, or skin penetrations - which are not stress wrinkles and do not interfere with internal structure\nof mechanism - constitute negligible damage; and rework is considered cosmetic.\nB.\nRepairable damage: Dents or dings deeper and/or larger than specied above must be repaired.\nSkin tears, cracks or penetrations must be repaired. Dings that include understructure (ribs, frames\nand spars) must be repaired by reforming or removal and replacement of the damaged member or\ndamaged are. Reevaluation of the skin after repair of the understructure will determine if the skin\ndamage is negligible, repairable or requires replacement.\nC.\nDamage Necessitating Replacement Of Parts: If a skin is badly damaged, repair must be made by\nreplacing an entire skin panel from one structural member to the next. Repair seams must be made\nto lie along structural members and each seam must be made exactly the same in regard to rivet size,\nspacing and pattern as the manufactured seams at the edges of the original sheet. If the manufactured\nseams are different, the stronger must be copied. If the repair ends at a structural member where\nno seam is used, enough repair panel must be used to allow an extra row of staggered rivets, with\nsufcient edge margin, to be installed."

        "answer": "WARNING: Inadequate panel replacement of the engine nacelle may compromise aircraft integrity. Always wear insulated gloves, follow approved methods, and check for discoloration before returning to service.\n\n1.\nGeneral\nA.\nAny repair that breaks the fuel bay seal will necessitate resealing that bay area. Repair parts that\nneed sealing must be installed during the sealing operations. All joints within the boundary of the\nbay, but which do not provide a direct fuel path out of the bay (such as fuel spar anges and rib\nanges), must be fay-surface-sealed and llet sealed on the fuel side. Fay surface sealing is applying\nsealant to one mating part before assembly. Enough sealant must be applied so it will squeeze out\ncompletely around joint when the parts are fastened together. The llet seal is applied after the joint\nis fay-surface-sealed and fastened. Sealer is (llet) applied to the edge of all riveted joints, joggles,\nbend reliefs, voids, rivets, or fasteners. All boundaries and any other place that could become a fuel\nleak are sealed. The fay sealant need not be cured before applying the llet sealer; however, the fay\nsealant must be free of dirt or other contaminants before applying llet seal. Fillets laid on intersecting\njoints shall be joined together to produce a continuous seal. Sealant must be pressed into the joint to\ndisplace any entrapped air bubbles. Use an extrusion gun to lay a bead along joint, and work out all\nentrapped air with a small paddle to eliminate bubbles."

        "answer": "NOTE: If the engine nacelle shows any signs of cracks, do not proceed with the panel replacement until proper inspection and corrective action have been taken.\n\n9.\nSpacing Of Rivets\nA.\nThere are no specic rules which are applicable to every case or type of riveting. There are, however,\ncertain general rules which should be understood and followed. Edge distance of rivets should not\nbe less than two diameters of the rivet, measured from the edge of the sheet or plate to the center of\nthe rivet hole. Spacing between rivets, when in rows, depends upon several factors, principally the\nthickness of the sheet, the diameter of the rivets, and the manner in which the sheet will be stressed.\nThis spacing is seldom less than four diameters of the rivet, measured between the centers of the rivet\nholes. Rivets, spaced four diameters apart, are found in certain seams of semimonocoque fuselages,\nwebs or built up spars, and various plates or ttings. Where there are two rows of rivets, they are\nusually staggered. The transverse pitch or distance between rows should be slightly less than the\npitch of the rivets, with 75 percent of the rivet pitch being the usual practice. An average spacing or\npitch of rivets in the cover or skin of most structures, except at highly stressed points, will be from 6\nto 12 diameters of the rivet. The best practice in repair is to make pitch of rivets equal to those in the\noriginal structure."

Only use protective materials and ensure that ambient temperature is met before proceeding.\n\n1.\nGeneral\nA.\nFor the purposes of this manual, damage is considered to be a deviation from the original\nconguration of a structural part that compromises its structural integrity by signicantly reducing its\nstrength, signicantly decreasing its resistance to fatigue, signicantly increasing its susceptibility to\ncorrosion, signicantly altering its utter characteristics, or adversely affecting the ight characteristics\nof the airplane. This can include - but is not limited to - scratches, dents, dings, gouges, cracks,\ndrill starts, double drilled holes, plastic deformation, reduction in cross-sectional areas, changes in\ncomponent center-of-gravity, missing or inadequate fasteners, corrosion, dissimilar metal contact,\nwork hardening, temper change due to excessive heat, and so forth.\nB.\nUse good judgment in determining the type of signicant change to at stock structural material. The\nterms, dent, crease, abrasion, gouge, nick, scratch, crack and corrosion, referred to elsewhere in the\nmanual, are dened below as a guide for this determination, particularly with respect to the external\nskin of the airplane:\n(1)\nDent - A dent is normally a damaged area which is depressed with respect to its normal contour.\nThere is no cross sectional area change in the material. Area boundaries are smooth. Its form\nis generally the result of contact with a relatively smoothly contoured object.\nNOTE:\nA dent-like form of damage to skin may be the result of the peening action of a\nsmoothly contoured object contacting it. If the inner surface of skin shows no contour\nchange, consider that such damage results in a local cross sectional area change.\n(2)\nCrease - A damaged area which is depressed or folded back upon itself in such a manner that its\nboundaries are sharp or well dened lines or ridges. Consider it to be the equivalent of a crack.\n(3)\nAbrasion - An abrasion is a damaged area of any size which results in a cross sectional area\nchange due to scufng, rubbing, scraping or other surface erosion.\nIt is usually rough and\nirregular.\n(4)\nGouge - A gouge is a damaged area of any size, which results in a cross sectional area change.\nIt is usually caused by contact with a relatively sharp object which produces a continuous, sharp\nor smooth channel-like groove in the material.\n(5)\nNick - A nick is a local gouge with sharp edges. Consider a series of nicks, in a line pattern to\nbe the equivalent of a gouge.\n(6)\nScratch - A scratch is a line of damage of any depth in the material and results in a cross sectional\narea change. It is usually caused by contact with a very sharp object.\n(7)\nCrack - A crack is a partial fracture or complete break in the material with the most signicant\ncross sectional area change. In appearance, it is usually an irregular line and is normally the\nresult of fatigue failure.\n(8)\nCorrosion - Corrosion, due to a complex electrochemical action, is a damaged area of any size\nand depth which results in a cross sectional area change. Depth of such pitting damage must\nbe determined by a cleanup operation. Damage of this type may occur on surfaces of structural\nelements. Refer to Corrosion and Corrosion Control, Section .\nC.\nUse good sense and proper visual measurement in the determination of signicant cross sectional\narea changes of both depth and length of any type (or combinations) of damage mentioned above."

The detectors can be used to determine when it is\nsafe to make repairs.\nNOTE:\nDuring structural repair, parts must be predrilled, countersunk or dimpled, and\ncleaned before being sealed and positioned for nal installation.\n(10) Remove all existing sealant from area to be sealed, leaving a taper to the remaining sealant.\nThe taper will allow a scarf bond and a continuous seal when the new sealant is applied.\nNOTE:\nThe best method of removing sealant is with a chisel-like tool made of hard ber or\nplexiglass. Remaining sealant can be removed with aluminum wool. Steel wool or\nsandpaper must not be used.\n(11) Stop drill cracks using a No. 30 (0.128 inch) drill.\n(12) Remove all ragged edges, dents, tears, cracks, and punctures.\n(13) After removal of damaged area, leave edges parallel to any square or rectangular edge of the\nunit.\nNOTE:\nDamage adjacent to a previous repair requires removal of old repair and inclusion of\nthe entire area in the new repair.\n(14) Round all corners.\n(15) Smooth out abrasions.\n(16) Vacuum thoroughly to remove all chips, lings, dirt, etc., from bay area.\n(17) All surfaces to be sealed after repair should be thoroughly cleaned by wiping with a clean cloth\ndampened with methyl propyl ketone (MPK), acetone or similar solvent, and dried with a clean\ncloth before allowing solvent to evaporate. Always pour the solvent on the cloth to prevent\ncontaminating solvent. Do not allow cloth to drip.

        "answer": "WARNING: Inadequate panel replacement of the engine nacelle may compromise aircraft integrity. Always wear insulated gloves, follow approved methods, and check for discoloration before returning to service.\n\n1.\nGeneral\nA.\nCorrosion is a natural phenomenon which destroys metal by chemical or electrochemical action and\nconverts it to a metallic compound such as an oxide, hydroxide, or sulfate. All metals used in airplane\nconstruction are subject to corrosion. If exposed, attack may take place over an entire metal surface.\nIt may penetrate a surface at random forming deep pits or may follow grain boundaries. Corrosion may\nbe accentuated by stresses from external loads or from lack of homogeneity in the metallic structure\nor from improper heat treatment. It is promoted by contact between dissimilar metals or with materials\nwhich absorb moisture such as wool, rubber, felt, dirt, and so forth.\nNOTE:\nFor additional information on corrosion control for aircraft, refer to the FAA Advisory Circular\nNo. 43-4.\n(1)\nRefer to Figure 1 for a simplied illustration of the conditions which must exist for electrochemical\ncorrosion to occur.\n(a)\nThere must be a metal that corrodes and acts as the anode.\n(b)\nThere must be a less corrodible metal that acts as the cathode\n(c)\nThere must be a continuous liquid path between the two metals which acts as the\nelectrolyte, usually condensation and salt or other contamination.\n(d)\nThere must be a conductor to carry the ow of electrons from the cathode to the anode.\nThis conductor is usually in the form of a metal-to-metal contact (rivets, bolts, welds, etc.)\n(2)\nThe elimination of any one of the four conditions described above will stop the corrosion reaction\nprocess as shown in Figure 1.\n(3)\nOne of the best ways to eliminate one of the four described conditions is to apply an organic lm\n(such as paint, grease, plastic, etc.) to the surface of the metal affected. This will prevent the\nelectrolyte from connecting the cathode to the anode, and since current cannot ow, it prevents\ncorrosive reaction.\n(4)\nAt normal atmospheric temperatures, metals do not corrode appreciably without moisture, but\nthe moisture in the air is usually enough to start corrosive action.\n(5)\nWhen components and systems constructed of many different types of metals must perform\nunder various climatic conditions, corrosion becomes a complex problem. The presence of salts\non metal surfaces (from sea coast operation) greatly increases the electrical conductivity of any\nmoisture present and accelerates corrosion.\n(6)\nOther environmental conditions which contribute to corrosion are:\n(a)\nMoisture collecting on dirt particles.\n(b)\nMoisture collecting in crevices between lap joints, around rivets, bolt, and screws."

Always verify tool availability before beginning.\n\n2.\nTypes of Corrosion\nA.\nDirect Surface Attack.\n(1)\nThe most common type of general surface corrosion results from direct reaction of a metal\nsurface with oxygen in the atmosphere. Unless properly protected, steel will rust and aluminum\nand magnesium will form oxides. The attack may be accelerated by salt spray or salt bearing\nair, by industrial gasses, or by engine exhaust gasses.\nB.\nPitting.\n(1)\nWhile pitting can occur in any metal, it is particularly characteristic of passive materials such\nas alloys of aluminum, nickel, and chromium. It is rst noticeable as a white or gray powdery\ndeposit similar to dust, which blotches the surface. When the deposits are cleaned away, tiny\npits can be seen in the surface.\nC.\nDissimilar Metal Corrosion.\n(1)\nWhen two dissimilar metals are in contact and are connected by an electrolyte (continuous liquid\nor gas path), accelerated corrosion of one of the metals occurs. The most easily oxidized surface\nbecomes the anode and corrodes. The less active member of the couple becomes the cathode\nof the galvanic cell. The degree of attack depends on the relative activity of the two surfaces; the\ngreater the difference in activity, the more severe the corrosion. Relative activity in descending\norder is as follows:\n(a)\nMagnesium and its alloys.\n(b)\nAluminum alloys 1100, 3003, 5052, 6061, 220, 355, 356, cadmium, and zinc.\n(c)\nAluminum alloys 2014, 2017, 2024, and 7075.\n(d)\nIron, lead, and their alloys (except stainless steel).\n(e)\nStainless steels, titanium, chromium, nickel, copper, and their alloys.\n(f)\nGraphite (including dry lm lubricants containing graphite).\nD.\nIntergranular Corrosion.\n(1)\nSelective attack along the grain boundaries in metal alloys is referred to as intergranular\ncorrosion. It results from lack of uniformity in the alloy structure. It is particularly characteristic\nof precipitation hardened alloys of aluminum and some stainless steels. Aluminum extrusions\nand forgings in general may contain nonuniform areas, which in turn may result in galvanic\nattack along the grain boundaries. When attack is well advanced, the metal may blister or\ndelaminate which is referred to as exfoliation.\nE.\nStress Corrosion.\n(1)\nThis results from the combined effect of static tensile stresses applied to a surface over\na period of time.\nIn general, cracking susceptibility increases with stress, particularly at\nstresses approaching the yield point, and with increasing temperature, exposure time, and\nconcentration of corrosive ingredients in the surrounding environment. Examples of parts which\nare susceptible to stress corrosion cracking are aluminum alloy bell cranks, landing gear shock\nstruts with pipe thread-type grease ttings, clevis points, and shrink ts.\nF.\nCorrosion Fatigue.\n(1)\nThis is a type of stress corrosion resulting from the cyclic stresses on a metal in corrosive\nsurroundings. Corrosion may start at the bottom of a shallow pit in the stressed area. Once\nattack begins, the continuous exing prevents repair of protective surface coating or oxide lms\nand additional corrosion takes place in the area of stress."

Carefully evacuate personnel, and consult section 05-20-00 of the maintenance manual for proper panel replacement steps.\n\n7.\nControl of Corrosion on Landing Gear Springs\nA.\nGeneral\n(1)\nThe main landing gear springs are made from high strength steel that is shot peened on the\nlower surface to increase the fatigue life of the part.\n(2)\nThe shot peened layer is between 0.010 and 0.020 inch thick.\n(3)\nIf the protective layer of paint is chipped, scratched or worn away the steel may corrode (rust).\n(a)\nIf the corrosion pit depth is greater than the thickness of the shot peen layer, the gear spring\nfatigue life will be greatly reduced.\n(4)\nOperation from unimproved surfaces increases the likelihood of damage.\nB.\nCorrosion removal and repair.\n(1)\nIf damage to the paint nish of the landing gear spring is found, examine the damage area for\nsigns of corrosion (red rust).\nWARNING: High strength steel parts are very susceptible to hydrogen\nembrittlement.\nAcidic solutions, such as rust removers\nand paint strippers have been found to cause hydrogen\nembrittlement.\nHydrogen embrittlement is an undetectable,\ntime delayed process.\nSince the process is time delayed,\nfailure may occur after the part is returned to service.\nThe\nonly reliable way to prevent hydrogen embrittlement is not to\nuse chemical rust removers or paint strippers on landing gear\nsprings.\n(2)\nCarefully remove any rust by light sanding.\n(a)\nThe sanding should blend the damage into the surrounding area in an approximate 20:1\nratio.\nEXAMPLE:\nAn 0.005 inch pit must be blended to a 0.10 inch radius or 0.20 inch\ndiameter.\n(b)\nMake sure the nal sanding marks are along an inboard to outboard direction, or along the\nlong dimension of the spring.\n(3)\nAfter the sanding is complete, measure the depth of the damage removal.\n(a)\nMake sure the depth of the damage is not more than 0.010 to 0.012 inch deep and has not\npenetrated the shot peen layer.\n(4)\nIf the shot peened layer has been penetrated, the gear spring must be removed and sent to an\napproved facility to be re-shotpeened.\n(a)\nThe shotpeen specication is to be Almen intensity of 0.012 to 0.016 using 330 steel shot.\n(5)\nAfter the spring is installed, renish any damaged or removed nish paint.\nNOTE:\nAdditional information regarding corrosion control can be found in AC-43-4, Chapter\n6, or AC43.13-1B Chapter 6.\nC.\nAxle bolt hole corrosion.\n(1)\nOperation of an airplane on skis increases the loads on the lower part of the gear spring because\nof the unsymmetrical and twisting loads.\n(a)\nThe increased loads have produced spring fractures that originate from pits in the axle\nattach holes.\n1\nCatastrophic failures have occurred from fatigue cracks as small as 0.003 to 0.010\ninch long that originated at pits.\n(b)\nAlthough operation on skis causes more loads, the criteria applies to all airplanes.\n(2)\nThere is no acceptable damage depth for pits that develop in the axle bolt holes. If pits or\ncorrosion is found it must be removed by reaming, subject to the following limitations:\n(a)\nRemove the minimum material required to clean up the damage.\n(b)\nMake sure the diameter of the axle attachment holes is 0.383 inches maximum for 3/8 inch\nbolts.\n(c)\nMake sure the diameter of the axle attachment holes is 0.321 inches maximum for 5/16\ninch bolts.\n(d)\nIf reaming to the maximum dimension does not remove all signs of corrosion, discard the\nlanding gear spring.\n"

        "question": "What are the specific guidelines for handling and interpreting the results of a feeler gauge test on a rivet, particularly in terms of determining the percentage of the circumference of the rivet head that can be inserted with the gauge without classifying the rivet as loose?",
        "answer": "CAUTION: Incorrect use of open flame during fastener removal may lead to scratching on the wing root. Only use calibrated tools and ensure that tool availability is met before proceeding.\n\n7.\nSolid Shank Rivets\nA.\nRemoval of Solid Shank Rivets (Refer to Figure 1).\n(1)\nWhen it becomes necessary to replace a rivet, extreme care should be taken in its removal so\nthat the rivet hole will retain its original size and replacement with a larger size rivet will not be\nnecessary. If the rivet is not removed properly, the strength of the joint may be weakened and\nthe replacement of rivets made more difcult.\n(2)\nWhen removing a rivet, work on the manufactured head. It is more symmetrical about the shank\nthan the shop head, and there will be less chance of damaging the rivet hole or the material\naround it. To remove rivets, use hand tools, a power drill or a combination of both. The preferred\nmethod is to drill through the rivet head and drive out the remainder of the rivet with a drift punch.\nFirst, le a at area on the head of any round or brazier head rivet, and center punch the at\nsurface for drilling. On thin metal, back up the rivet on the shop head when center punching\nto avoid depressing the metal. The dimple in 2117-T3 rivets usually eliminates the necessity of\nling and center punching the rivet.\n(3)\nSelect a drill one size smaller than the rivet shank and drill out the rivet head. When using a\npower drill, set the drill on the rivet and rotate the chuck several revolutions by hand before\nturning on the power. This procedure helps the drill cut a good starting spot and eliminates the\nchance of the drill slipping off and tracking across the metal. While holding the drill at a 90\u00b0\nangle, drill the rivet to the depth of its head. Be careful not to drill too deep because the rivet\nshank will turn with the drill and cause a tear. The rivet head will often break away and climb the\ndrill, which is a good signal to withdraw the drill. If the rivet head does not come lose of its own\naccord, insert a drift punch into the hole and twist slightly to either side until the head comes off.\n(4)\nDrive out the shank of the rivet with a drift punch slightly smaller than the diameter of the shank.\nOn thin metal or unsupported structures, support the sheet with a bucking bar while driving out\nthe shank. If the shank is exceptionally tight after the rivet head is removed, drill the rivet about\ntwo-thirds of the way through the thickness of the material and then drive out the remainder of\nthe rivet with a drift punch.\n(5)\nThe removal of ush rivets is the same as that just described except that no ling of the\nmanufactured head is required before center punching. Be very careful to avoid elongation\nof the dimpled or the countersunk holes. The rivet head should be drilled to approximately\none-half the thickness of the top sheet.\nTable 1.

NAS1738M4-4\nrivets may be identied as AIA/NAS1738M4-4.\nC.\nInstallation of Solid Shank Rivets.\n(1)\nA large percentage of riveting of airplane structure is accomplished on thin gauge aluminum alloy,\nand the work must be accomplished without distorting or damaging the material with hammer\nblows or riveting tools. All airplane power riveting is accomplished by upsetting the rivets against\na bucking bar instead of striking the shank with a hammer. To prevent deforming the rivet head,\na rivet set must be selected to t each type of rivet. The depth of this set must not touch material\nbeing riveted. Parts requiring heat treatment should be heat treated before riveting, since heat\ntreating process after rivet installation causes warping. Assemblies that require heat treatment\nin a salt bath must be treated prior to assembly, as the salt cannot be entirely washed out of the\njoints.\n(2)\nThe use of hollow rivets in joining highly stressed parts is not permitted. To determine if blind\nrivets may be substituted, refer to Tables 1 and 2. Selection of the proper rivet and the proper\nnumber of rivets is very important. Rivets must be of the proper length for the total thickness of\nthe parts being riveted. Ordinarily, from 1-1/2 to 2 times the diameter of the rivet is the correct\namount for the rivet shank to protrude through the material to form the head. For heavy material,\nsuch as plates or ttings, from 2 to 2-1/2 times the rivet diameter may be used. The rivet should\nnot be excessively loose in the hole, as this condition will cause the rivet to bend over while\nbeing driven, and the shank will not be sufciently expanded to completely ll the hole. A drill\nfrom 0.002 inch to 0.004 inch larger than the rivet shank should be used for sheet and plate\nriveting. Parts should be held rmly together by clamps, screws, or bolts while they are being\ndrilled or riveted. The bucking bar is to be held against the end of the rivet shank. Exercise care\nwhile accomplishing this operation to prevent unseating the rivet by too much pressure. For the\nrst few blows, the bucking bar should be held lightly against the rivet shank so it will receive\nthe impact of the blow through the rivet. The bucking bar must be held square with the rivet\nto produce uniform upsets. As few blows as possible should be struck to properly upset rivet.\nBlows must be as uniform as possible.\nD.\nLoose Or Working Solid Shank Rivets.\n(1)\nRivets which appear to be loose shall be checked with a 0.002 inch feeler gauge by inserting the\ngauge around the head of the rivet in question. If the feeler gauge can be inserted to the shank\nof the rivet, it shall be classied as a loose rivet and it shall be replaced. If the feeler gauge can\nbe inserted approximately halfway to the shank for less than 30 percent of the circumference\nof the rivet head, it shall not be classied as a loose rivet. The feeler gauge shall be used to\ncheck the shear section between the riveted members (such as skin to spar or different sections\nof skins) in a similar manner to that used around the rivet head. If the skin around the brazier\nhead or countersunk rivet can be moved by depressing the skin with nger pressure around the\nrivet, the rivet shall be replaced. If a rivet is found which turns by applying a rotating load to the\nhead of the rivet, it should be replaced.\n(2)\nIn areas where exterior paint has been applied to rivet heads, the paint may harden due to aging\nprocesses and show hairline cracks around the edge of the rivet heads. This should not be\nused as a basis for determining whether or not the rivet is loose. The hardened paint may crack\nat times and collect dirt or exhaust fumes which will appear as discoloration. It is not possible\nto detect loose rivets visually. Replacement rivets should be of like size and type. In some\ninstances, however, it will be necessary to use the next size larger diameter. For general repair\npractices, the spacing between the centerlines of adjacent rivet holes shall be four diameters or\ngreater. In some areas where the spacing between rivets prohibits the use of the next larger\nrivets, special repair instructions and procedures shall be followed.\nContact Cessna Single\nEngine Support."

Stainless steel helical coil inserts of special design are installed in all spark\nplug holes. Any of these inserts may be replaced if damaged. Tools, inserts and information\nare available through HeliCoil\u00ae, Emhart Fastening Teknologies. Contact HeliCoil\u00ae\nApplications Engineering or customer service at: (203) 924-4737 for local distributor\ninformation. The manufacturer's Bulletins 959A, 995, 943, T4000 and 1000 latest revisions\nlist manual and power-driven installing tools, tang break-off tools, special taps, plug gauges\nand tap/drill information. Helical coil inserts are available in both National Course and\nNational Fine series in lengths equal to 1, 1 -1 /2 and 2 times nominal diameter and in pipe\nthread sizes. They are made of either carbon steel, phosphor bronze or stainless steel, as\nspecified by part number. They are supplied with or without a notch above the driving tang.\nThe notch is provided to facilitate breaking off the tang in open holes.\nHelical coil inserts are helical coils of wire with a diamond-shaped cross section forming both\na male and female thread. When compressed into a special tapped hole at the widest part of\nthe wire, between male and female threads, the diameter of the insert is equal to the nominal\nscrew size. The special finishing taps size the casting hole so the pitch diameter of the\nfemale thread of the installed insert conforms to Class 3 fit with standard bolt threads or class\n4 (tight) fit with standard-size studs. The difference in fit is due to a difference in pitch\ndiameters of bolts and studs. Only one set of helical coil special taps is required for\ninstallation of these inserts in both bolt holes and stud holes. Tap drilling depths and tapping\ndepth for helical coil inserts to be installed in blind holes should conform to the\nrecommendations relative to inserts of length equal to 2 times nominal diameter, as tabulated\nin the manufacturer's Bulletin Numbers 1000 and T4000 latest revision. Helical coil tap drills\nand special taps must be run in perpendicular to the machined surface of the casting. Drilling\nmust be done in a drill press after the casting is firmly supported, clamped and alignment\nchecked. The tap will tend to follow the drilled hole. For drilling and tapping aluminum alloy\ncastings use a commercial grade cutting lubrication oil to prevent overheating of the metal\nand tearing of the thread."

Blind rivets do not have the\nsame resistance to corrosion and fatigue as solid shank rivets, and should not be considered a\nuniversal replacement for solid shank rivets.\nB.\nRemoval of Blind Rivets.\nCAUTION: Do not drill completely through the rivet sleeve. This method of removing\na rivet will tend to enlarge the hole.\n(1)\nUse a small center drill to provide a guide for a larger drill on top of the rivet stem, and drill away\nthe tapered portion of the stem to destroy the lock.\n(2)\nPry the remainder of the locking collar out of the rivet head with a drift punch.\n(3)\nDrill nearly through the head of the rivet using a drill the same size as the rivet shank.\n(4)\nBreak off rivet head, using drift pin inserted into the drilled hole as a pry.\n(5)\nDrive out remaining rivet shank with a pin having a diameter equal to the rivet shank.\nC.\nInstallation of Blind Rivets.\n(1)\nRefer to Figure 2, for an illustration of installation procedures.\n(2)\nCheck that rivet hole size and rivet are compatible.\n(3)\nCheck that proper pulling head is installed on rivet gun.\n(4)\nAdjustment of pulling head must be made in accordance with manufacturers instructions.\n(5)\nCheck that proper operating air pressure is available to rivet gun.\nNOTE:\nBlind rivets may be installed using pneumatic or mechanical guns, whichever is\navailable.\n(6)\nCheck that holes in parts to be fastened are properly aligned.\n(7)\nIn blind clearance applications, check the minimum blind clearance (BK) dimension if the\nmanufactured head of blind rivet is protruding above the top sheet. The rivet will pull down the\nsheet as the stem is pulled if the BK dimension is met or exceeded.\n(8)\nThe minimum blind clearance is the BK dimension, and is listed in the manufacturers standard\nsheets.\nNOTE:\nWhen installing a blind rivet (pull-type rivet) in a hole where the previous blind rivet\nwas removed by drilling and punching the rivet out, inspect the drilled hole to assure\nall metal sheets are in place and not separated prior to pulling rivet.\nIt may be\nnecessary to insert a stiff wire in adjacent hole to hold metal in position while pulling\nrivet.\n(9)\nWhen placing pulling head on rivet stem, hold riveter and pulling head in line with axis of rivet\nwhile holding tool in a light and exible manner.\n(10) When tool is actuated, pulling head will pull down and seat against rivet head.\n(11) Clamping action will pull sheets together and seat rivet when tool is actuated.\n(12) When tool is actuated, action of rivet will automatically assist in bringing tool and pulling head\ninto proper alignment with rivet axis.\nNOTE:\nPressing down with force will not allow rivet and tool to align themselves with hole\nand could limit head setting of rivet, however, enough force to seat the head against\nthe skin is necessary.\n(13) Hold tool in line with rivet as accurately as possible, and allow a steady but light pressure; pull\ntrigger and let the rivet align itself.\n(14) When rivet is completely installed, release trigger and pulling head will eject pulling portion of\nstem through forward end.\n(15) Rivet must break within these limits.\nFastener\nDash number\nStem Flushness\nNAS1738 or NAS1739\nAll\n+0.010 or -0.020 inch\nCherry Max\n-4\n+0.010 or -0.015 inch\nCherry Max\n-5, -6\n+0.010 or -0.020 inch\n(16) Protruding stems usually indicate incorrect grip length or oversize holes.\nD.\nLoose or Working Blind Rivets.\n(1)\nBlind rivets which are found to be loose or show evidence of working must be replaced with\nrivets of like size and type. In some instances, it may be necessary to use the next larger size\nrivet. Loose fasteners may be indicated by the following situation:\n(a)\nThe fastened material moves relative to the fastener. Skin deection is evident.\n(b)\nTipping of the fastener head may indicate its looseness or slippage. Rivet head periphery\nrolled upward also indicates looseness.\n(c)\nA black or dark gray stain is found adjacent to or around the fastener head. Generally, it\ntakes the form of a dirt or oily streak aft of the loose rivet.\n(d)\nMark a red line across the fastener head and the adjacent material. Check the line at the\nnext inspection. Any loosening of the fastener will break the line as indicated in Figure 3."

        "question": "What is the recommended course of action when wrinkles appear in the skin structure of a metal airplane that do not follow the general appearance of the remainder of the skin panels or appear to have originated from other sources?",
        "answer": "CAUTION: Incorrect use of solvent cleaners during panel replacement may lead to scratching on the wing root. Only use protective materials and ensure that ambient temperature is met before proceeding.\n\n2.\nNegligible Damage\nA.\nAny smooth dents in the fuselage skin that are free from cracks, abrasions, and sharp corners, and\nwhich are not stress wrinkles and do not interfere with any internal structure or mechanism, may\nbe considered as negligible damage. In areas of low stress intensity, cracks, deep scratches, or\ndeep, sharp dents - which after trimming or stop-drilling can be enclosed by a two-inch circle - can\nbe considered negligible if the damaged area is at least one diameter of the enclosing circle away\nfrom all existing rivet lines and material edges. Stop drilling is considered a temporary repair and a\npermanent repair must be made as soon as practical.\nB.\nMild corrosion appearing upon clad aluminum surfaces does not necessarily indicate incipient failure of\nthe base metal. However, corrosion of all types must be carefully considered, and approved remedial\naction taken.\nC.\nSmall cans appear in the skin structure of all metal airplanes and should not necessarily be a cause\nfor concern. However. It is strongly recommended that wrinkles which appear to have originated from\nother sources, or which do not follow the general appearance of the remainder of the skin panels, be\nthoroughly investigated. Except in the landing gear bulkhead areas, wrinkles occurring over stringers\nwhich disappear when the rivet pattern is removed, may be considered negligible. However, the\nstringer rivet holes may not align perfectly with skin holes because of a permanent \"set\" in the stringer.\nIf this is apparent, replacement of the stringer will usually restore the original strength characteristics\nof the area.\nNOTE:\nWrinkles occurring in the skin of the main landing gear bulkhead areas must not be\nconsidered negligible. The skin panel must be opened sufciently to permit a thorough\nexamination of the lower portion of the landing gear bulkhead and its tie-in structure.\nD.\nWrinkles occurring in open areas which disappear when the rivets at the edge of the sheet are\nremoved, or a wrinkle which is hand removable, may often be repaired by a 1/2 inch x 1/2 inch x\n0.050 inch 2024-T42 extruded angle or a heavy \u201cJ\u201d section. The angle should be inserted fore and\naft across the center of the wrinkle and should extend to within 1/16 inch to 1/8 inch of the fuselage\nbulkheads comprising the end of the bay. Rivet pattern should be similar to existing manufactured\nseam at edge of sheet.\nE.\nNegligible damage to stringers, formed skin anges, bulkhead channel and like parts is similar to\nthat for the wing skin. Refer to Chapter 57, Wing Damage Classication for a denition of negligible\ndamage to these components."

        "answer": "CAUTION: Before beginning any fastener removal, verify that the fuselage skin is isolated and secured. {Mistake} may result in unnecessary rework or component leakage.\n\n8.\nBlind Rivets\nA.\nGeneral.\n(1)\nBlind rivets are intended for use where access is available to only one side of the work.\n(2)\nReplacement of solid rivets with blind rivets should only be accomplished within the guidelines\nof Table 1, when the installation of a solid shank rivet is not possible. Blind rivets do not have the\nsame resistance to corrosion and fatigue as solid shank rivets, and should not be considered a\nuniversal replacement for solid shank rivets.\nB.\nRemoval of Blind Rivets.\nCAUTION: Do not drill completely through the rivet sleeve. This method of removing\na rivet will tend to enlarge the hole.\n(1)\nUse a small center drill to provide a guide for a larger drill on top of the rivet stem, and drill away\nthe tapered portion of the stem to destroy the lock.\n(2)\nPry the remainder of the locking collar out of the rivet head with a drift punch.\n(3)\nDrill nearly through the head of the rivet using a drill the same size as the rivet shank.\n(4)\nBreak off rivet head, using drift pin inserted into the drilled hole as a pry.\n(5)\nDrive out remaining rivet shank with a pin having a diameter equal to the rivet shank.\nC.\nInstallation of Blind Rivets.\n(1)\nRefer to Figure 2, for an illustration of installation procedures.\n(2)\nCheck that rivet hole size and rivet are compatible.\n(3)\nCheck that proper pulling head is installed on rivet gun.\n(4)\nAdjustment of pulling head must be made in accordance with manufacturers instructions.\n(5)\nCheck that proper operating air pressure is available to rivet gun.\nNOTE:\nBlind rivets may be installed using pneumatic or mechanical guns, whichever is\navailable.\n(6)\nCheck that holes in parts to be fastened are properly aligned.\n(7)\nIn blind clearance applications, check the minimum blind clearance (BK) dimension if the\nmanufactured head of blind rivet is protruding above the top sheet. The rivet will pull down the\nsheet as the stem is pulled if the BK dimension is met or exceeded.\n(8)\nThe minimum blind clearance is the BK dimension, and is listed in the manufacturers standard\nsheets.\nNOTE:\nWhen installing a blind rivet (pull-type rivet) in a hole where the previous blind rivet\nwas removed by drilling and punching the rivet out, inspect the drilled hole to assure\nall metal sheets are in place and not separated prior to pulling rivet.\nIt may be\nnecessary to insert a stiff wire in adjacent hole to hold metal in position while pulling\nrivet.\n(9)\nWhen placing pulling head on rivet stem, hold riveter and pulling head in line with axis of rivet\nwhile holding tool in a light and exible manner.\n(10) When tool is actuated, pulling head will pull down and seat against rivet head.\n(11) Clamping action will pull sheets together and seat rivet when tool is actuated.\n(12) When tool is actuated, action of rivet will automatically assist in bringing tool and pulling head\ninto proper alignment with rivet axis.\nNOTE:\nPressing down with force will not allow rivet and tool to align themselves with hole\nand could limit head setting of rivet, however, enough force to seat the head against\nthe skin is necessary.\n(13) Hold tool in line with rivet as accurately as possible, and allow a steady but light pressure; pull\ntrigger and let the rivet align itself.\n(14) When rivet is completely installed, release trigger and pulling head will eject pulling portion of\nstem through forward end.\n(15) Rivet must break within these limits.\nFastener\nDash number\nStem Flushness\nNAS1738 or NAS1739\nAll\n+0.010 or -0.020 inch\nCherry Max\n-4\n+0.010 or -0.015 inch\nCherry Max\n-5, -6\n+0.010 or -0.020 inch\n(16) Protruding stems usually indicate incorrect grip length or oversize holes.\nD.\nLoose or Working Blind Rivets.\n(1)\nBlind rivets which are found to be loose or show evidence of working must be replaced with\nrivets of like size and type. In some instances, it may be necessary to use the next larger size\nrivet. Loose fasteners may be indicated by the following situation:\n(a)\nThe fastened material moves relative to the fastener. Skin deection is evident.\n(b)\nTipping of the fastener head may indicate its looseness or slippage. Rivet head periphery\nrolled upward also indicates looseness.\n(c)\nA black or dark gray stain is found adjacent to or around the fastener head. Generally, it\ntakes the form of a dirt or oily streak aft of the loose rivet.\n(d)\nMark a red line across the fastener head and the adjacent material. Check the line at the\nnext inspection. Any loosening of the fastener will break the line as indicated in Figure 3."

        "question": "In situations where visual inspection is not feasible due to obstruction by structural members or equipment installations, what alternative methods or tools can be employed to facilitate a thorough inspection of the metal surface for corrosion detection?",
        "answer": "CAUTION: If tool availability is not confirmed, abort the panel replacement and conduct a full inspection of the fuselage skin. Failure to follow this step can result in misalignment.\n\n4.\nCorrosion Detection\nA.\nThe primary means of corrosion detection is visual, but in situations where visual inspection is not\nfeasible, other techniques must be used. The use of liquid dye penetrants, magnetic particle, X-ray,\nand ultrasonic devices can be used, but most of these sophisticated techniques are intended for the\ndetection of physical aws within metal objects rather than the detection of corrosion.\n(1)\nVisual Inspection.\n(a)\nA visual check of the metal surface can reveal the signs of corrosive attack, the most\nobvious of which is a corrosive deposit. Corrosion deposits of aluminum or magnesium\nare generally a white or grayish-white powder, while the color of ferrous compounds varies\nfrom red to dark reddish-brown.\n1\nThe indications of corrosive attack are small localized discoloration of the metal\nsurface. Surfaces protected by paint or plating may only exhibit indications of more\nadvanced corrosive attack by the presence of blisters or bulges in the protective lm.\nBulges in lap joints are indications of corrosive buildup which is well advanced.\n2\nIn may cases, because the inspection area is obscured by structural members,\nequipment installations, or for other reasons, it is awkward to check visually. In such\ncases, mirrors, boroscopes, or like devices must be used to inspect the obscured\nareas. Any means which allows a thorough inspection can be used. Magnifying\nglasses are valuable aids for determining whether or not all corrosion products have\nbeen removed during cleanup operations.\n(2)\nLiquid Dye Penetrant Inspection.\n(a)\nInspection for large stress-corrosion or corrosion fatigue cracks on nonporous or\nnonferrous metals may be accomplished using dye penetrant processes. The dye applied\nto a clean metallic surface will enter small openings or cracks by capillary action. After\nthe dye has an opportunity to be absorbed by any surface discontinuities, the excess dye\nis removed and a developer is applied to the surface. The developer acts like a blotter to\ndraw the dye from cracks or ssures back to the surface, giving visible indication of any\nfault that is present on the surface. The magnitude of the fault is indicated by the quantity\nof dye brought back to the surface by the developer."

        "question": "What characteristics of a metal's surface and environment contribute to the formation of pitting, particularly in passive materials such as alloys of aluminum, nickel, and chromium?",
        "answer": "NOTE: This procedure applies specifically to aircraft models with engine nacelle configurations post-2015. For older models, refer to AMM revision 22B or later. Always verify tool availability before beginning.\n\n2.\nTypes of Corrosion\nA.\nDirect Surface Attack.\n(1)\nThe most common type of general surface corrosion results from direct reaction of a metal\nsurface with oxygen in the atmosphere. Unless properly protected, steel will rust and aluminum\nand magnesium will form oxides. The attack may be accelerated by salt spray or salt bearing\nair, by industrial gasses, or by engine exhaust gasses.\nB.\nPitting.\n(1)\nWhile pitting can occur in any metal, it is particularly characteristic of passive materials such\nas alloys of aluminum, nickel, and chromium. It is rst noticeable as a white or gray powdery\ndeposit similar to dust, which blotches the surface. When the deposits are cleaned away, tiny\npits can be seen in the surface.\nC.\nDissimilar Metal Corrosion.\n(1)\nWhen two dissimilar metals are in contact and are connected by an electrolyte (continuous liquid\nor gas path), accelerated corrosion of one of the metals occurs. The most easily oxidized surface\nbecomes the anode and corrodes. The less active member of the couple becomes the cathode\nof the galvanic cell. The degree of attack depends on the relative activity of the two surfaces; the\ngreater the difference in activity, the more severe the corrosion. Relative activity in descending\norder is as follows:\n(a)\nMagnesium and its alloys.\n(b)\nAluminum alloys 1100, 3003, 5052, 6061, 220, 355, 356, cadmium, and zinc.\n(c)\nAluminum alloys 2014, 2017, 2024, and 7075.\n(d)\nIron, lead, and their alloys (except stainless steel).\n(e)\nStainless steels, titanium, chromium, nickel, copper, and their alloys.\n(f)\nGraphite (including dry lm lubricants containing graphite).\nD.\nIntergranular Corrosion.\n(1)\nSelective attack along the grain boundaries in metal alloys is referred to as intergranular\ncorrosion. It results from lack of uniformity in the alloy structure. It is particularly characteristic\nof precipitation hardened alloys of aluminum and some stainless steels. Aluminum extrusions\nand forgings in general may contain nonuniform areas, which in turn may result in galvanic\nattack along the grain boundaries. When attack is well advanced, the metal may blister or\ndelaminate which is referred to as exfoliation.\nE.\nStress Corrosion.\n(1)\nThis results from the combined effect of static tensile stresses applied to a surface over\na period of time.\nIn general, cracking susceptibility increases with stress, particularly at\nstresses approaching the yield point, and with increasing temperature, exposure time, and\nconcentration of corrosive ingredients in the surrounding environment. Examples of parts which\nare susceptible to stress corrosion cracking are aluminum alloy bell cranks, landing gear shock\nstruts with pipe thread-type grease ttings, clevis points, and shrink ts.\nF.\nCorrosion Fatigue.\n(1)\nThis is a type of stress corrosion resulting from the cyclic stresses on a metal in corrosive\nsurroundings. Corrosion may start at the bottom of a shallow pit in the stressed area. Once\nattack begins, the continuous exing prevents repair of protective surface coating or oxide lms\nand additional corrosion takes place in the area of stress."

        "answer": "WARNING: Inadequate panel replacement of the engine nacelle may compromise aircraft integrity. Always wear insulated gloves, follow approved methods, and check for discoloration before returning to service.\n\n1.\nGeneral\nA.\nCorrosion is a natural phenomenon which destroys metal by chemical or electrochemical action and\nconverts it to a metallic compound such as an oxide, hydroxide, or sulfate. All metals used in airplane\nconstruction are subject to corrosion. If exposed, attack may take place over an entire metal surface.\nIt may penetrate a surface at random forming deep pits or may follow grain boundaries. Corrosion may\nbe accentuated by stresses from external loads or from lack of homogeneity in the metallic structure\nor from improper heat treatment. It is promoted by contact between dissimilar metals or with materials\nwhich absorb moisture such as wool, rubber, felt, dirt, and so forth.\nNOTE:\nFor additional information on corrosion control for aircraft, refer to the FAA Advisory Circular\nNo. 43-4.\n(1)\nRefer to Figure 1 for a simplied illustration of the conditions which must exist for electrochemical\ncorrosion to occur.\n(a)\nThere must be a metal that corrodes and acts as the anode.\n(b)\nThere must be a less corrodible metal that acts as the cathode\n(c)\nThere must be a continuous liquid path between the two metals which acts as the\nelectrolyte, usually condensation and salt or other contamination.\n(d)\nThere must be a conductor to carry the ow of electrons from the cathode to the anode.\nThis conductor is usually in the form of a metal-to-metal contact (rivets, bolts, welds, etc.)\n(2)\nThe elimination of any one of the four conditions described above will stop the corrosion reaction\nprocess as shown in Figure 1.\n(3)\nOne of the best ways to eliminate one of the four described conditions is to apply an organic lm\n(such as paint, grease, plastic, etc.) to the surface of the metal affected. This will prevent the\nelectrolyte from connecting the cathode to the anode, and since current cannot ow, it prevents\ncorrosive reaction.\n(4)\nAt normal atmospheric temperatures, metals do not corrode appreciably without moisture, but\nthe moisture in the air is usually enough to start corrosive action.\n(5)\nWhen components and systems constructed of many different types of metals must perform\nunder various climatic conditions, corrosion becomes a complex problem. The presence of salts\non metal surfaces (from sea coast operation) greatly increases the electrical conductivity of any\nmoisture present and accelerates corrosion.\n(6)\nOther environmental conditions which contribute to corrosion are:\n(a)\nMoisture collecting on dirt particles.\n(b)\nMoisture collecting in crevices between lap joints, around rivets, bolt, and screws."

Remove balancing beam and balance the beam itself by adding\nwashers or nuts required at end opposite the trailing edge support.\n(6)\nWhen positioning balancing beam on control surface, avoid rivets to provide a smooth surface\nfor the beam and keep the beam 90 degrees to the hinge line of control surface.\n(7)\nPaint is a considerable weight factor.\nIn order to keep balance weight to a minimum, it\nis recommended that existing paint be removed before adding paint to a control surface.\nIncrease in balance weight will also be limited by the amount of space available and clearance\nwith adjacent parts.\nGood workmanship and standard repair practices should not result in\nunreasonable balance weight.\n(8)\nThe approximate amount of weight needed may be determined by taping loose weight at the\nbalance weight area.\n(9)\nLighten balance weight by drilling off part of weight.\n(10) Make balance weight heavier by fusing bar stock solder to weight after removal from control\nsurface. The ailerons should have balance weight increased by ordering additional weight and\ngang channel, listed in applicable Parts Catalog, and installing next to existing inboard weight\nthe minimum length necessary for correct balance, except that a length which contains at least\ntwo attaching screws must be used.

        "answer": "WARNING: Inadequate panel replacement of the engine nacelle may compromise aircraft integrity. Always wear insulated gloves, follow approved methods, and check for discoloration before returning to service.\n\n1.\nGeneral\nA.\nCorrosion is a natural phenomenon which destroys metal by chemical or electrochemical action and\nconverts it to a metallic compound such as an oxide, hydroxide, or sulfate. All metals used in airplane\nconstruction are subject to corrosion. If exposed, attack may take place over an entire metal surface.\nIt may penetrate a surface at random forming deep pits or may follow grain boundaries. Corrosion may\nbe accentuated by stresses from external loads or from lack of homogeneity in the metallic structure\nor from improper heat treatment. It is promoted by contact between dissimilar metals or with materials\nwhich absorb moisture such as wool, rubber, felt, dirt, and so forth.\nNOTE:\nFor additional information on corrosion control for aircraft, refer to the FAA Advisory Circular\nNo. 43-4.\n(1)\nRefer to Figure 1 for a simplied illustration of the conditions which must exist for electrochemical\ncorrosion to occur.\n(a)\nThere must be a metal that corrodes and acts as the anode.\n(b)\nThere must be a less corrodible metal that acts as the cathode\n(c)\nThere must be a continuous liquid path between the two metals which acts as the\nelectrolyte, usually condensation and salt or other contamination.\n(d)\nThere must be a conductor to carry the ow of electrons from the cathode to the anode.\nThis conductor is usually in the form of a metal-to-metal contact (rivets, bolts, welds, etc.)\n(2)\nThe elimination of any one of the four conditions described above will stop the corrosion reaction\nprocess as shown in Figure 1.\n(3)\nOne of the best ways to eliminate one of the four described conditions is to apply an organic lm\n(such as paint, grease, plastic, etc.) to the surface of the metal affected. This will prevent the\nelectrolyte from connecting the cathode to the anode, and since current cannot ow, it prevents\ncorrosive reaction.\n(4)\nAt normal atmospheric temperatures, metals do not corrode appreciably without moisture, but\nthe moisture in the air is usually enough to start corrosive action.\n(5)\nWhen components and systems constructed of many different types of metals must perform\nunder various climatic conditions, corrosion becomes a complex problem. The presence of salts\non metal surfaces (from sea coast operation) greatly increases the electrical conductivity of any\nmoisture present and accelerates corrosion.\n(6)\nOther environmental conditions which contribute to corrosion are:\n(a)\nMoisture collecting on dirt particles.\n(b)\nMoisture collecting in crevices between lap joints, around rivets, bolt, and screws."

Before beginning the sealant application, ensure that the area is free of coolant vapor and personnel are wearing inspection mirror.\n\n2.\nRivets\nA.\nStandard solid shank MS rivets are those generally used in airplane construction.\nThey are\nfabricated in the following head types:\nroundhead, athead, countersunk head, and universal\nhead. Flathead rivets are generally used in the airplane interior, where head clearance is required.\nMS20426 countersunk head rivets are used on the exterior surfaces of the airplane to minimize\nturbulent airow. MS20470 universal head rivets are used on the exterior surfaces of the airplane\nwhere strength requirements necessitate a stronger rivet head than that of the countersunk head\nrivet. Hi-Shear rivets are special, patented rivets having a high shear strength equivalent to that of\nstandard NAS bolts. They are used in special cases in locations where high shear loads are present,\nsuch as in spars, wings, and in heavy bulkhead ribs. This rivet consists of a cadmium plated pin of\nalloy steel.

        "answer": "WARNING: ventilate area. Failure to secure all panels before fastener removal may lead to fire hazard. Always inspect the wing root and verify that aircraft model.\n\n4.\nSubstitution Of Rivets\nA.\nWhen adapting the typical repairs shown in this manual to suit actual conditions, it may be necessary\nto use different fasteners than those originally used. This may be due to non-availability of a particular\nfastener, restricted access, or other difculties. When replacing rivets, it is desirable to use rivets\nidentical to the type of rivet removed. Countersunk head rivets are to be replaced by rivets of the\nsame type and degree of countersink. When rivet holes become enlarged, deformed, or otherwise\ndamaged, several options are available.\n(1)\nThe simplest solution is to install a 1/32 inch (0.032 inch) larger size rivet as a replacement. This\nsolution uses the designed repairability of the structure, and is the quickest repair.\n(2)\nRepair rivets are available.\n(a)\nRepair rivets have a shank that is 1/64 inch (0.016 inch) larger diameter than a standard\nrivet but have the same size and shape heads.\n(b)\nNAS1241 repair rivets replace MS20426 rivets if they have the same sufx.\n(c)\nNAS1242 repair rivets replace MS20470 rivets if they have the same sufx.\n(d)\nNAS1738, NAS1939 and some NAS9301 through NAS9311 blind rivets also have oversize\nshanks.\nB.\nReplacement shall not be made with rivets of lower strength material.\nC.\nHi-Shear Rivets.\n(1)\nWhen Hi-Shear rivets are not available, replacement of sizes 3/16 inch or greater rivets shall be\nmade with bolts of equal or greater strength than the rivet being replaced, and with self-locking\nnuts of the same diameter. It is permissible to replace Hi-Shear rivets with Hi-Lok bolts of the\nsame material, diameter and grip length.\nD.\nBlind Rivets.\n(1)\nBlind rivets have higher deection rates in shear than standard solid rivets, are more susceptible\nto fatigue failure and are not as strong as solid rivets in thin sheets. For this reason, it is not\nadvisable to replace any considerable number of solid rivets in a given joint by blind rivets,\nbecause this may result in overstressing the remaining solid rivets. The hollow blind rivet shall\nnot be used. The blind rivet shall be of the same or greater strength than the rivet it replaces. In\ncases of dimpled assemblies (the process of forming the metal around a hole to form a conical\nindentation to receive the tapered head of a ush rivet or a screw), the rivet holes shall be\ndrilled after the sheets are dimpled. When possible, the exposed end of each clipped plug\nshall be coated with epoxy primer. Blind rivets shall not be used in fuel bay areas except in\ncases of absolute necessity, and must be sealed. If blind fasteners other than blind rivets are\nencountered, it is recommended that replacements be made with identical fasteners.\nE.\nFor a list of approved solid shank and Hi-Shear rivet substitutions, refer to Tables 1 and 2."

The mount attaches to\nthe rewall at four points and to the engine using rubber isolation mounts at four points.\nNOTE:\nRepair by gas welding is acceptable.\n2.\nEngine Mount Repairs\nA.\nThe following procedures are to be used when making repairs to the engine mount. Refer to Figure\n801.\n(1)\nAll welding on the engine mounts should be of the highest quality, since the tendency of vibration\nwill accentuate any minor defect present and cause fatigue cracks. Engine mount members\nare preferably repaired by using larger diameter replacement tube welds. However, reinforced\n30-degree scarf welds in place of the shmouth welds are considered satisfactory for engine\nmount repair work.\n(2)\nMinor damage, such as a crack adjacent to an engine attaching lug, may be repaired by\nrewelding the tube and extending a gusset past the damaged area. Extensively damaged parts\nmust be replaced.\n(3)\nEngine mounting lugs and engine mount-to-fuselage attach ttings should be replaced, not\nrepaired.\n(4)\nFor information on damage beyond the scope of these repairs, consult Cessna Propeller\nAircraft Product Support, P.O.

Refer to appropriate Maintenance\nManual, Chapter 20, Torque Data - Maintenance Practices, for additional information covering torque\nvalues. Under torque can result in unnecessary wear of nuts and bolts as well as parts they are\nholding together. When insufcient pressures are applied, uneven loads will be transmitted throughout\nassembly, which may result in excessive wear or premature failure due to fatigue. Over torque can\nbe equally damaging because of failure of a bolt or nut from overstressing threaded areas. There are\na few simple, but very important, procedures that should be followed to assure that correct torque is\napplied:\n(1)\nCalibrate torque wrench periodically to assure accuracy, and recheck frequently.\n(2)\nBe sure that bolt and nut threads are clean and dry unless otherwise specied.\n(3)\nRun nut down to near contact with washer or bearing surface and check friction drag torque\nrequired to turn nut.\n(4)\nAdd friction drag torque to desired torque recommended. Refer to appropriate Maintenance\nManual, Chapter 20, Torque Data - Maintenance Practices to obtain complete torque calculating\nprocedures. This is referred to as nal torque which should register on indicator or setting for a\nsnap over-type wrench.\n(5)\nApply a smooth even pull when applying torque pressure. If chattering or a jerking motion occurs\nduring nal torque, back off and re-torque.\n(6)\nWhen installing a castellated nut, start alignment with cotter pin hole at minimum recommended\ntorque plus friction drag torque, and do not exceed maximum torque plus friction drag. If hole\nand nut castellation do not align, change washers or nut and try again. Exceeding maximum\nrecommended torque is not recommended unless specically allowed or recommended for that\nparticular installation."

        "answer": "CAUTION: Incorrect use of solvent cleaners during panel replacement may lead to scratching on the wing root. Only use protective materials and ensure that ambient temperature is met before proceeding.\n\n1.\nGeneral\nA.\nFor the purposes of this manual, damage is considered to be a deviation from the original\nconguration of a structural part that compromises its structural integrity by signicantly reducing its\nstrength, signicantly decreasing its resistance to fatigue, signicantly increasing its susceptibility to\ncorrosion, signicantly altering its utter characteristics, or adversely affecting the ight characteristics\nof the airplane. This can include - but is not limited to - scratches, dents, dings, gouges, cracks,\ndrill starts, double drilled holes, plastic deformation, reduction in cross-sectional areas, changes in\ncomponent center-of-gravity, missing or inadequate fasteners, corrosion, dissimilar metal contact,\nwork hardening, temper change due to excessive heat, and so forth.\nB.\nUse good judgment in determining the type of signicant change to at stock structural material. The\nterms, dent, crease, abrasion, gouge, nick, scratch, crack and corrosion, referred to elsewhere in the\nmanual, are dened below as a guide for this determination, particularly with respect to the external\nskin of the airplane:\n(1)\nDent - A dent is normally a damaged area which is depressed with respect to its normal contour.\nThere is no cross sectional area change in the material. Area boundaries are smooth. Its form\nis generally the result of contact with a relatively smoothly contoured object.\nNOTE:\nA dent-like form of damage to skin may be the result of the peening action of a\nsmoothly contoured object contacting it. If the inner surface of skin shows no contour\nchange, consider that such damage results in a local cross sectional area change.\n(2)\nCrease - A damaged area which is depressed or folded back upon itself in such a manner that its\nboundaries are sharp or well dened lines or ridges. Consider it to be the equivalent of a crack.\n(3)\nAbrasion - An abrasion is a damaged area of any size which results in a cross sectional area\nchange due to scufng, rubbing, scraping or other surface erosion.\nIt is usually rough and\nirregular.\n(4)\nGouge - A gouge is a damaged area of any size, which results in a cross sectional area change.\nIt is usually caused by contact with a relatively sharp object which produces a continuous, sharp\nor smooth channel-like groove in the material.\n(5)\nNick - A nick is a local gouge with sharp edges. Consider a series of nicks, in a line pattern to\nbe the equivalent of a gouge.\n(6)\nScratch - A scratch is a line of damage of any depth in the material and results in a cross sectional\narea change. It is usually caused by contact with a very sharp object.\n(7)\nCrack - A crack is a partial fracture or complete break in the material with the most signicant\ncross sectional area change. In appearance, it is usually an irregular line and is normally the\nresult of fatigue failure.\n(8)\nCorrosion - Corrosion, due to a complex electrochemical action, is a damaged area of any size\nand depth which results in a cross sectional area change. Depth of such pitting damage must\nbe determined by a cleanup operation. Damage of this type may occur on surfaces of structural\nelements. Refer to Corrosion and Corrosion Control, Section .\nC.\nUse good sense and proper visual measurement in the determination of signicant cross sectional\narea changes of both depth and length of any type (or combinations) of damage mentioned above."

Always wear insulated gloves, follow approved methods, and check for discoloration before returning to service.\n\nHelical coil inserts are installed at the factory in various tapped holes of some engine\ncomponents. Stainless steel helical coil inserts of special design are installed in all spark\nplug holes. Any of these inserts may be replaced if damaged. Tools, inserts and information\nare available through HeliCoil\u00ae, Emhart Fastening Teknologies. Contact HeliCoil\u00ae\nApplications Engineering or customer service at: (203) 924-4737 for local distributor\ninformation. The manufacturer's Bulletins 959A, 995, 943, T4000 and 1000 latest revisions\nlist manual and power-driven installing tools, tang break-off tools, special taps, plug gauges\nand tap/drill information. Helical coil inserts are available in both National Course and\nNational Fine series in lengths equal to 1, 1 -1 /2 and 2 times nominal diameter and in pipe\nthread sizes. They are made of either carbon steel, phosphor bronze or stainless steel, as\nspecified by part number. They are supplied with or without a notch above the driving tang.\nThe notch is provided to facilitate breaking off the tang in open holes.\nHelical coil inserts are helical coils of wire with a diamond-shaped cross section forming both\na male and female thread. When compressed into a special tapped hole at the widest part of\nthe wire, between male and female threads, the diameter of the insert is equal to the nominal\nscrew size. The special finishing taps size the casting hole so the pitch diameter of the\nfemale thread of the installed insert conforms to Class 3 fit with standard bolt threads or class\n4 (tight) fit with standard-size studs. The difference in fit is due to a difference in pitch\ndiameters of bolts and studs. Only one set of helical coil special taps is required for\ninstallation of these inserts in both bolt holes and stud holes. Tap drilling depths and tapping\ndepth for helical coil inserts to be installed in blind holes should conform to the\nrecommendations relative to inserts of length equal to 2 times nominal diameter, as tabulated\nin the manufacturer's Bulletin Numbers 1000 and T4000 latest revision. Helical coil tap drills\nand special taps must be run in perpendicular to the machined surface of the casting. Drilling\nmust be done in a drill press after the casting is firmly supported, clamped and alignment\nchecked. The tap will tend to follow the drilled hole. For drilling and tapping aluminum alloy\ncastings use a commercial grade cutting lubrication oil to prevent overheating of the metal\nand tearing of the thread."

Always inspect the wing root and verify that aircraft model.\n\n4.\nSubstitution Of Rivets\nA.\nWhen adapting the typical repairs shown in this manual to suit actual conditions, it may be necessary\nto use different fasteners than those originally used. This may be due to non-availability of a particular\nfastener, restricted access, or other difculties. When replacing rivets, it is desirable to use rivets\nidentical to the type of rivet removed. Countersunk head rivets are to be replaced by rivets of the\nsame type and degree of countersink. When rivet holes become enlarged, deformed, or otherwise\ndamaged, several options are available.\n(1)\nThe simplest solution is to install a 1/32 inch (0.032 inch) larger size rivet as a replacement. This\nsolution uses the designed repairability of the structure, and is the quickest repair.\n(2)\nRepair rivets are available.\n(a)\nRepair rivets have a shank that is 1/64 inch (0.016 inch) larger diameter than a standard\nrivet but have the same size and shape heads.\n(b)\nNAS1241 repair rivets replace MS20426 rivets if they have the same sufx.\n(c)\nNAS1242 repair rivets replace MS20470 rivets if they have the same sufx.\n(d)\nNAS1738, NAS1939 and some NAS9301 through NAS9311 blind rivets also have oversize\nshanks.\nB.\nReplacement shall not be made with rivets of lower strength material.\nC.\nHi-Shear Rivets.\n(1)\nWhen Hi-Shear rivets are not available, replacement of sizes 3/16 inch or greater rivets shall be\nmade with bolts of equal or greater strength than the rivet being replaced, and with self-locking\nnuts of the same diameter. It is permissible to replace Hi-Shear rivets with Hi-Lok bolts of the\nsame material, diameter and grip length.\nD.\nBlind Rivets.\n(1)\nBlind rivets have higher deection rates in shear than standard solid rivets, are more susceptible\nto fatigue failure and are not as strong as solid rivets in thin sheets. For this reason, it is not\nadvisable to replace any considerable number of solid rivets in a given joint by blind rivets,\nbecause this may result in overstressing the remaining solid rivets. The hollow blind rivet shall\nnot be used. The blind rivet shall be of the same or greater strength than the rivet it replaces. In\ncases of dimpled assemblies (the process of forming the metal around a hole to form a conical\nindentation to receive the tapered head of a ush rivet or a screw), the rivet holes shall be\ndrilled after the sheets are dimpled. When possible, the exposed end of each clipped plug\nshall be coated with epoxy primer. Blind rivets shall not be used in fuel bay areas except in\ncases of absolute necessity, and must be sealed. If blind fasteners other than blind rivets are\nencountered, it is recommended that replacements be made with identical fasteners.\nE.\nFor a list of approved solid shank and Hi-Shear rivet substitutions, refer to Tables 1 and 2."

Always wear insulated gloves, follow approved methods, and check for discoloration before returning to service.\n\nHelical coil inserts are installed at the factory in various tapped holes of some engine\ncomponents. Stainless steel helical coil inserts of special design are installed in all spark\nplug holes. Any of these inserts may be replaced if damaged. Tools, inserts and information\nare available through HeliCoil\u00ae, Emhart Fastening Teknologies. Contact HeliCoil\u00ae\nApplications Engineering or customer service at: (203) 924-4737 for local distributor\ninformation. The manufacturer's Bulletins 959A, 995, 943, T4000 and 1000 latest revisions\nlist manual and power-driven installing tools, tang break-off tools, special taps, plug gauges\nand tap/drill information. Helical coil inserts are available in both National Course and\nNational Fine series in lengths equal to 1, 1 -1 /2 and 2 times nominal diameter and in pipe\nthread sizes. They are made of either carbon steel, phosphor bronze or stainless steel, as\nspecified by part number. They are supplied with or without a notch above the driving tang.\nThe notch is provided to facilitate breaking off the tang in open holes.\nHelical coil inserts are helical coils of wire with a diamond-shaped cross section forming both\na male and female thread. When compressed into a special tapped hole at the widest part of\nthe wire, between male and female threads, the diameter of the insert is equal to the nominal\nscrew size. The special finishing taps size the casting hole so the pitch diameter of the\nfemale thread of the installed insert conforms to Class 3 fit with standard bolt threads or class\n4 (tight) fit with standard-size studs. The difference in fit is due to a difference in pitch\ndiameters of bolts and studs. Only one set of helical coil special taps is required for\ninstallation of these inserts in both bolt holes and stud holes. Tap drilling depths and tapping\ndepth for helical coil inserts to be installed in blind holes should conform to the\nrecommendations relative to inserts of length equal to 2 times nominal diameter, as tabulated\nin the manufacturer's Bulletin Numbers 1000 and T4000 latest revision. Helical coil tap drills\nand special taps must be run in perpendicular to the machined surface of the casting. Drilling\nmust be done in a drill press after the casting is firmly supported, clamped and alignment\nchecked. The tap will tend to follow the drilled hole. For drilling and tapping aluminum alloy\ncastings use a commercial grade cutting lubrication oil to prevent overheating of the metal\nand tearing of the thread."

Frequently, the force causing the initial damage is transmitted\nfrom one member to the next, causing strains and distortions. Abnormal stresses incurred by shock\nor impact forces on a rib, bulkhead, or similar structure, may be transmitted to the extremity of the\nstructural member, resulting in secondary damage, such as sheared or stretched rivets, elongated bolt\nholes, or canned skins or bulkheads. Points of attachment should be examined carefully for distortion\nand security of fastenings in the primary and secondary damaged areas at locations beyond the local\ndamage. This is particularly true with wing tip, horizontal stabilizer tip, or vertical n tip damage. If\nthe damage is due to an aft load, the rear spars should be checked for indications of compression\ndamage for the full length, including the fuselage components."

        "answer": "CAUTION: Incorrect use of solvent cleaners during panel replacement may lead to scratching on the wing root. Only use protective materials and ensure that ambient temperature is met before proceeding.\n\n1.\nGeneral\nA.\nFor the purposes of this manual, damage is considered to be a deviation from the original\nconguration of a structural part that compromises its structural integrity by signicantly reducing its\nstrength, signicantly decreasing its resistance to fatigue, signicantly increasing its susceptibility to\ncorrosion, signicantly altering its utter characteristics, or adversely affecting the ight characteristics\nof the airplane. This can include - but is not limited to - scratches, dents, dings, gouges, cracks,\ndrill starts, double drilled holes, plastic deformation, reduction in cross-sectional areas, changes in\ncomponent center-of-gravity, missing or inadequate fasteners, corrosion, dissimilar metal contact,\nwork hardening, temper change due to excessive heat, and so forth.\nB.\nUse good judgment in determining the type of signicant change to at stock structural material. The\nterms, dent, crease, abrasion, gouge, nick, scratch, crack and corrosion, referred to elsewhere in the\nmanual, are dened below as a guide for this determination, particularly with respect to the external\nskin of the airplane:\n(1)\nDent - A dent is normally a damaged area which is depressed with respect to its normal contour.\nThere is no cross sectional area change in the material. Area boundaries are smooth. Its form\nis generally the result of contact with a relatively smoothly contoured object.\nNOTE:\nA dent-like form of damage to skin may be the result of the peening action of a\nsmoothly contoured object contacting it. If the inner surface of skin shows no contour\nchange, consider that such damage results in a local cross sectional area change.\n(2)\nCrease - A damaged area which is depressed or folded back upon itself in such a manner that its\nboundaries are sharp or well dened lines or ridges. Consider it to be the equivalent of a crack.\n(3)\nAbrasion - An abrasion is a damaged area of any size which results in a cross sectional area\nchange due to scufng, rubbing, scraping or other surface erosion.\nIt is usually rough and\nirregular.\n(4)\nGouge - A gouge is a damaged area of any size, which results in a cross sectional area change.\nIt is usually caused by contact with a relatively sharp object which produces a continuous, sharp\nor smooth channel-like groove in the material.\n(5)\nNick - A nick is a local gouge with sharp edges. Consider a series of nicks, in a line pattern to\nbe the equivalent of a gouge.\n(6)\nScratch - A scratch is a line of damage of any depth in the material and results in a cross sectional\narea change. It is usually caused by contact with a very sharp object.\n(7)\nCrack - A crack is a partial fracture or complete break in the material with the most signicant\ncross sectional area change. In appearance, it is usually an irregular line and is normally the\nresult of fatigue failure.\n(8)\nCorrosion - Corrosion, due to a complex electrochemical action, is a damaged area of any size\nand depth which results in a cross sectional area change. Depth of such pitting damage must\nbe determined by a cleanup operation. Damage of this type may occur on surfaces of structural\nelements. Refer to Corrosion and Corrosion Control, Section .\nC.\nUse good sense and proper visual measurement in the determination of signicant cross sectional\narea changes of both depth and length of any type (or combinations) of damage mentioned above."

        "answer": "CAUTION: If tool availability is not confirmed, abort the panel replacement and conduct a full inspection of the fuselage skin. Failure to follow this step can result in misalignment.\n\n4.\nCorrosion Detection\nA.\nThe primary means of corrosion detection is visual, but in situations where visual inspection is not\nfeasible, other techniques must be used. The use of liquid dye penetrants, magnetic particle, X-ray,\nand ultrasonic devices can be used, but most of these sophisticated techniques are intended for the\ndetection of physical aws within metal objects rather than the detection of corrosion.\n(1)\nVisual Inspection.\n(a)\nA visual check of the metal surface can reveal the signs of corrosive attack, the most\nobvious of which is a corrosive deposit. Corrosion deposits of aluminum or magnesium\nare generally a white or grayish-white powder, while the color of ferrous compounds varies\nfrom red to dark reddish-brown.\n1\nThe indications of corrosive attack are small localized discoloration of the metal\nsurface. Surfaces protected by paint or plating may only exhibit indications of more\nadvanced corrosive attack by the presence of blisters or bulges in the protective lm.\nBulges in lap joints are indications of corrosive buildup which is well advanced.\n2\nIn may cases, because the inspection area is obscured by structural members,\nequipment installations, or for other reasons, it is awkward to check visually. In such\ncases, mirrors, boroscopes, or like devices must be used to inspect the obscured\nareas. Any means which allows a thorough inspection can be used. Magnifying\nglasses are valuable aids for determining whether or not all corrosion products have\nbeen removed during cleanup operations.\n(2)\nLiquid Dye Penetrant Inspection.\n(a)\nInspection for large stress-corrosion or corrosion fatigue cracks on nonporous or\nnonferrous metals may be accomplished using dye penetrant processes. The dye applied\nto a clean metallic surface will enter small openings or cracks by capillary action. After\nthe dye has an opportunity to be absorbed by any surface discontinuities, the excess dye\nis removed and a developer is applied to the surface. The developer acts like a blotter to\ndraw the dye from cracks or ssures back to the surface, giving visible indication of any\nfault that is present on the surface. The magnitude of the fault is indicated by the quantity\nof dye brought back to the surface by the developer."

Always verify tool availability before beginning.\n\n11.\nRivets for Plastic or Composite Parts\nA.\nUnlike rivets in metallic joints, blind rivets are often the rivet of choice for riveting non-metallic materials\nbecause they may be installed without the hammering necessary to install solid rivets. If the tail end\nof the rivet is adjacent to the non-metal side, install a washer over the shank to prevent the \"hole\nlling\" action built into blind rivets from overloading the non-metal hole. The hole in the washer should\nmatch the specied installation hole for the fastener. If the tail end of the rivet is installed through\nmetal substructure, the washer is not necessary.\nB.\nSoft (\"A\" 1100 aluminum shank rivets or \"B\" 5056 aluminum shank) rivets are also used to install non-\nmetallic parts. Original equipment soft rivets will be either red or green colored under the paint. If the\nbutt or driven end of the rivet is adjacent to the non-metallic part, it is preferable to install a washer over\nthe shank to prevent the rivet shank, which swells during driving, from overloading the non-metallic\nhole. The hole in the washer should match the specied installation hole for the fastener. If the tail\nend of the rivet is installed through metal substructure, the washer is not necessary. Take care when\ndriving rivets through non-metal to not overdrive the rivet. If the rivet is overdriven, the shank will swell\neven with the washer in place. The rivet butt should be driven to no more than necessary to retain\nthe part, never more than 1.4 times the shank diameter.\nC.\nIf the original equipment rivet provided connection between metal parts as well as non-metallic parts,\nit may be a standard (AD) rivet.

Always wear insulated gloves, follow approved methods, and check for discoloration before returning to service.\n\nHelical coil inserts are installed at the factory in various tapped holes of some engine\ncomponents. Stainless steel helical coil inserts of special design are installed in all spark\nplug holes. Any of these inserts may be replaced if damaged. Tools, inserts and information\nare available through HeliCoil\u00ae, Emhart Fastening Teknologies. Contact HeliCoil\u00ae\nApplications Engineering or customer service at: (203) 924-4737 for local distributor\ninformation. The manufacturer's Bulletins 959A, 995, 943, T4000 and 1000 latest revisions\nlist manual and power-driven installing tools, tang break-off tools, special taps, plug gauges\nand tap/drill information. Helical coil inserts are available in both National Course and\nNational Fine series in lengths equal to 1, 1 -1 /2 and 2 times nominal diameter and in pipe\nthread sizes. They are made of either carbon steel, phosphor bronze or stainless steel, as\nspecified by part number. They are supplied with or without a notch above the driving tang.\nThe notch is provided to facilitate breaking off the tang in open holes.\nHelical coil inserts are helical coils of wire with a diamond-shaped cross section forming both\na male and female thread. When compressed into a special tapped hole at the widest part of\nthe wire, between male and female threads, the diameter of the insert is equal to the nominal\nscrew size. The special finishing taps size the casting hole so the pitch diameter of the\nfemale thread of the installed insert conforms to Class 3 fit with standard bolt threads or class\n4 (tight) fit with standard-size studs. The difference in fit is due to a difference in pitch\ndiameters of bolts and studs. Only one set of helical coil special taps is required for\ninstallation of these inserts in both bolt holes and stud holes. Tap drilling depths and tapping\ndepth for helical coil inserts to be installed in blind holes should conform to the\nrecommendations relative to inserts of length equal to 2 times nominal diameter, as tabulated\nin the manufacturer's Bulletin Numbers 1000 and T4000 latest revision. Helical coil tap drills\nand special taps must be run in perpendicular to the machined surface of the casting. Drilling\nmust be done in a drill press after the casting is firmly supported, clamped and alignment\nchecked. The tap will tend to follow the drilled hole. For drilling and tapping aluminum alloy\ncastings use a commercial grade cutting lubrication oil to prevent overheating of the metal\nand tearing of the thread."

        "answer": "WARNING: solvent cleaners must never be used near fuselage skin due to risk of toxic exposure. Before beginning the sealant application, ensure that the area is free of coolant vapor and personnel are wearing inspection mirror.\n\n2.\nRivets\nA.\nStandard solid shank MS rivets are those generally used in airplane construction.\nThey are\nfabricated in the following head types:\nroundhead, athead, countersunk head, and universal\nhead. Flathead rivets are generally used in the airplane interior, where head clearance is required.\nMS20426 countersunk head rivets are used on the exterior surfaces of the airplane to minimize\nturbulent airow. MS20470 universal head rivets are used on the exterior surfaces of the airplane\nwhere strength requirements necessitate a stronger rivet head than that of the countersunk head\nrivet. Hi-Shear rivets are special, patented rivets having a high shear strength equivalent to that of\nstandard NAS bolts. They are used in special cases in locations where high shear loads are present,\nsuch as in spars, wings, and in heavy bulkhead ribs. This rivet consists of a cadmium plated pin of\nalloy steel. Some have a collar of aluminum alloy. Some of these rivets can be readily identied by\nthe presence of the attached collar in place of the formed head on standard rivets. Blind rivets are\nused, where strength requirements permit, where one side of the structure is inaccessible, making it\nimpossible or impractical to drive standard solid shank rivets."

        "question": "What is the role of metal-to-metal contact, such as through rivets, bolts, or welds, in facilitating the flow of electrons between the cathode and anode in the electrochemical corrosion process of metals used in airplane construction?",
        "answer": "WARNING: Inadequate panel replacement of the engine nacelle may compromise aircraft integrity. Always wear insulated gloves, follow approved methods, and check for discoloration before returning to service.\n\n1.\nGeneral\nA.\nCorrosion is a natural phenomenon which destroys metal by chemical or electrochemical action and\nconverts it to a metallic compound such as an oxide, hydroxide, or sulfate. All metals used in airplane\nconstruction are subject to corrosion. If exposed, attack may take place over an entire metal surface.\nIt may penetrate a surface at random forming deep pits or may follow grain boundaries. Corrosion may\nbe accentuated by stresses from external loads or from lack of homogeneity in the metallic structure\nor from improper heat treatment. It is promoted by contact between dissimilar metals or with materials\nwhich absorb moisture such as wool, rubber, felt, dirt, and so forth.\nNOTE:\nFor additional information on corrosion control for aircraft, refer to the FAA Advisory Circular\nNo. 43-4.\n(1)\nRefer to Figure 1 for a simplied illustration of the conditions which must exist for electrochemical\ncorrosion to occur.\n(a)\nThere must be a metal that corrodes and acts as the anode.\n(b)\nThere must be a less corrodible metal that acts as the cathode\n(c)\nThere must be a continuous liquid path between the two metals which acts as the\nelectrolyte, usually condensation and salt or other contamination.\n(d)\nThere must be a conductor to carry the ow of electrons from the cathode to the anode.\nThis conductor is usually in the form of a metal-to-metal contact (rivets, bolts, welds, etc.)\n(2)\nThe elimination of any one of the four conditions described above will stop the corrosion reaction\nprocess as shown in Figure 1.\n(3)\nOne of the best ways to eliminate one of the four described conditions is to apply an organic lm\n(such as paint, grease, plastic, etc.) to the surface of the metal affected. This will prevent the\nelectrolyte from connecting the cathode to the anode, and since current cannot ow, it prevents\ncorrosive reaction.\n(4)\nAt normal atmospheric temperatures, metals do not corrode appreciably without moisture, but\nthe moisture in the air is usually enough to start corrosive action.\n(5)\nWhen components and systems constructed of many different types of metals must perform\nunder various climatic conditions, corrosion becomes a complex problem. The presence of salts\non metal surfaces (from sea coast operation) greatly increases the electrical conductivity of any\nmoisture present and accelerates corrosion.\n(6)\nOther environmental conditions which contribute to corrosion are:\n(a)\nMoisture collecting on dirt particles.\n(b)\nMoisture collecting in crevices between lap joints, around rivets, bolt, and screws."
